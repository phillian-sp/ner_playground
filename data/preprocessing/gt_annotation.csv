on down there Altogether I have been to 56 affairs including Halloween There is this Oak Room which is to the right if you want to have a broken mint or something like that And you have to go downstairs to the Rendezvous Room which is very good for hiding over a long period of time and for doing a tour jeté or so The Package Room has all these packages in it and sometimes I have to help them lift those heavy boxes and look for small packages that might be for me ELOISE Sometimes I go into the Men's Room which is very good for playing Railroad Station or something like that Every Wednesday I have to go to the Barber Shop and have Vincent shape my hair He does absolutely nothing but talk and swiggles me around in that chair and hurts my neck with that whiskbroom Sometimes I sklonk him in the kneecap Vincent says that if I am not careful I am not going to have a hair on my head by the time I'm 7 for Lord's sake Getting bored is not allowed Sometimes I comb my hair with a
