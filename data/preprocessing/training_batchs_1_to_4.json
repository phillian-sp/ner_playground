Band-aids and when she came back home she was weak weak weak and had to take cod-liver oil I gave her a strawberry leaf from under my grapefruit for not whimpering and Weenie licked her face They have

time I'm on the telephone My day is rawther full I have to call the Valet and tell him to get here and pick up my sneakers to be cleaned and pressed and have them back for sure without fail Then I have to play the piano and look in the mirror for a while Then I have to open and close the door for a while and as soon as I hear talking and laughing I skidder out and run down the hall and if there is an open door I have to walk in and pretend I am an orphan and sometimes I limp and sort of bend to the side and look sort of sad in between the arms and they give me a piece of melon or something Then I roam around the halls Then I have to scurry down to the 10th floor to adjust those thermostats in case anyone needs it If there's a fire on the 6th floor I know how to fix it Then I have to hide and see what those Hotel Officers are up to All they do is walk and talk I have never been arrested Then I have to hurry back to the top floor Our day maid's name is Johanna She has earrings with

want it or not, like ribbon or something like that Then I have to go down to help the Switchboard Operators in case there are any D As and there has to be some sort of message taken or something like that If there is an Exit sign I always have to go into it because there might be a mattress in there and I can lie down on it and get some rest so I can carry on for Lord's sake Oh my Lord I am absolutely so busy I don't know how I can possibly get everything done Then I have to hop around for a while I have lunch at the Palm Court if it is too rainy and see Thomas We are both rawther fond of talking and he gives me Gugelhopfen Thomas has a son in the Marines who got married on a shoestring Thomas has a Corvette I always go in the Persian Room after 4 to see my friend Bill He is a busboy in the night and goes to school in the day and his eyes water Here's where he's been Madrid Here's where I've been Boiler Room I go to the Powder Room as often as I can You just step on it Then I scamper to the Terrace Room where those debutantes are prancing around Then I have to skibble into the Baroque Room because sometimes there is this chalk and there is this pitcher with ice water in it and you should see the cigar smoke left over from a General Motors meeting Oh my Lord Then I have to help the busboys and waiters get set up in the Crystal Room They always wait until the last second for Lord's sake and then we have to rush our feet off I go to all the weddings in the White and Gold room and I usually stay for the reception There are absolutely nothing but rooms in the Plaza Sometimes if they are having this enormous affair in the Grand Ballroom I get there early to help Joe set up the lights in the ceiling and before anybody gets there we just scamper up this ladder and hide up there in those holes Oh my Lord is it ever swelteringly hot up there I always wear my sun visor I am all over the hotel Half the time I am lost But mostly I am on the first floor because that's where Catering is So I have to go down there every day for at least three hours and sometimes I have to go at night Oh my Lord do they ever have a lot of things going on down there Altogether I have been to 56 affairs including Halloween There is this Oak Room which is to the right if you want to have a broken mint or something like that And you have to go downstairs to the Rendezvous Room which is very good for hiding over a long period of time and for doing a tour jet\u00e9 or so The Package Room has all these packages in it and sometimes I have to help them lift those heavy boxes and look for small packages that might be for me ELOISE Sometimes I go into the Men's Room which is very good for playing Railroad Station or something like that Every Wednesday I have to go to the Barber Shop and have Vincent shape my hair He does absolutely nothing but talk and swiggles me around in that chair and hurts my neck with that whiskbroom Sometimes I sklonk him in the kneecap Vincent says that if I am not careful I am not going to have a hair on my head by the time I'm 7 for Lord's sake Getting bored is not allowed Sometimes I comb my hair with a fork Sometimes I wear my arm in a sling Sometimes I put a rubber band on the end of my nose Toe shoes make very good ears Sometimes I wear them to lunch Here's what I like to do Pretend Sometimes I am a mother with 40 children Sometimes I am a giant with fire coming out of my hair Sometimes I get terribly sick and have to be waited on Sometimes I get so sick my head falls over and is wobbling until it is loose Then

makes a very good hat My mother knows Lily Dach\u00e9 She goes to Europe and to Paris And when she goes to Miami she stays at the Roney and sends for me if there's some sun I am always packed in case I have to leave on TWA at a moment's notice or something like that My mother has A T & T stock and she knows an ad man whatever that is Sometimes my mother goes to Virginia with her lawyer He has an office on Madison Avenue He has already had the whooping cough and the measles Sometimes I give him rubber candy He is absolutely so dumb he eats it Sometimes he brings me a present whether I deserve it or not I usually do Here's what he likes Martinis Here's what I like Grass Sometimes I have a temper fit But not very often I absolutely dislike school so Philip is my tutor He goes to Andover My
