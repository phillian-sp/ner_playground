THUS, THE TWO SISTERS MAINTAINED BALANCE FOR THEIR KINGDOM AND THEIR SUBJECTS -- ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PONIES. BUT AS TIME WENT ON, THE YOUNGER SISTER BECAME RESENTFUL. THE PONIES RELISHED AND PLAYED IN THE DAY HER ELDER SISTER BROUGHT FORTH BUT SHUNNED AND SLEPT THROUGH HER BEAUTIFUL NIGHT. ONE FATEFUL DAY, THE YOUNGER UNICORN REFUSED TO LOWER THE MOON TO MAKE WAY FOR THE DAWN. THE ELDER SISTER TRIED TO REASON WITH HER, BUT THE BITTERNESS IN THE YOUNG ONE'S HEART HAD TRANSFORMED HER INTO A WICKED MARE OF DARKNESS -- NIGHTMARE MOON. SHE VOWED THAT SHE WOULD SHROUD THE LAND IN ETERNAL NIGHT. RELUCTANTLY, THE ELDER SISTER HARNESSED THE MOST POWERFUL MAGIC KNOWN TO PONYDOM -- THE ELEMENTS OF HARMONY.

AND IF YOU HAVEN'T MET ANYONE YET, YOU MUST NOT HAVE ANY FRIENDS. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS, THEN YOU MUST BE LONELY. AND THAT MADE ME SO SAD. AND I HAD AN IDEA. AND THAT'S WHY I WENT \"I SHOULD THROW A GREAT, BIG, GINORMOUS, SUPER-DUPER, SPECTACULAR WELCOME PARTY AND INVITE EVERYONE IN PONYVILLE.\" SEE? AND NOW YOU HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF FRIENDS. Applejack: ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SUGAR CUBE? AWW! SHE'S SO HAPPY, SHE'S CRYING. HOT SAUCE. OOH. WHAT? THIS IS GOOD. UGH.

LEGEND HAS IT THAT ON THE LONGEST DAY OF THE 1,000th YEAR, THE STARS WILL AID IN HER ESCAPE, AND SHE WILL BRING ABOUT EVERLASTING NIGHT. I HOPE THE PRINCESS WAS RIGHT. I HOPE IT REALLY IS JUST AN OLD PONY TALE. Spike: COME ON, TWILIGHT! IT'S TIME TO WATCH THE SUN RISE. ISN'T THIS EXCITING? ARE YOU EXCITED? 'CAUSE I'M EXCITED. I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED. WELL, EXCEPT FOR THE TIME THAT I SAW YOU WALKING INTO TOWN, AND I WENT BUT, I MEAN, REALLY, WHO CAN TOP THAT? FILLIES AND GENTLECOLTS, AS MAYOR OF PONYVILLE, IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO ANNOUNCE THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER SUN CELEBRATION.

YOU'RE THE MARE IN THE MOON, NIGHTMARE MOON. WELL, WELL, WELL. SOMEPONY WHO REMEMBERS ME. THEN YOU ALSO KNOW WHY I'M HERE. YOU'RE HERE TO...TO...

If you take a dash of baking and mix it with a sprinkle of engineering, you get delectable dessert creations and a brand-new frosted frontier. The country's best bakers and smartest engineers have come together to form nine teams who will compete for $100,000 and the title of World's Best Bakineers. They'll bake and build incredible, engineered mouth-watering marvels that will be put to the ultimate test. Boundaries will be broken. Oh, my gosh. Thought it was the tin! Wow. Unimaginable cakes will be created. The edible will become incredible. Science has never tasted so sweet. Oh, my God. Holy smokes! Wow! I love it! Oh, my God. So cool. Hi, judges. Hello. Hey, Justin. I have scoured the country to find the best bakers, the finest, most ingenious engineers, and I've paired them together to create some bakineering magic. And they've never met each other before. Awkward. Hey, how you doing? I'm good. I'm Mario. Joey. Nice meeting you. Nice to meet you. I'm from Lima, Peru. New York City, born and raised. Born and raised in New York. Right. So, what are those so many and pans for? Sautéing. Uh-huh. I'm very excited to transform from just a baker into a bakineer. I love learning new things because I'm competitive in anything I put my hands in. I don't let kids win. I'm sorry. Check this out. It's so… I am Sierra. Um, I'm a cake artist. Pleased to meet ya. Look at all this stuff down here. I kind of like to think of myself as just a general artist who happened to choose cake as a medium. We're gonna make some good stuff here. My name's Edwin. I am a self-described underwater circuits performer. I am an engineer. I've built everything from a functional manned submarine to a glow-in-the-dark spirograph. I've been inventing pretty much my whole life. At three years old, I always had itchy toes. So, I had taken, like, a toy RC car apart. I pulled the motors and wheels out of it, put it on the end of a stick and, boom, I built myself an automatic toe scratcher. Who is this person? Where did y'all find him? Well, hello. You guys ready for this? These bakineers have no idea what's about to hit 'em. Mission launch in three, two… Whoa. -…one. Go. All right, let's do it. Let's go. We're ready. Sailboats? We have to build a freakin' boat? Sailboat? My God. Must have at least one sail. Servo and rudder, that's my thing. Okay, so cake base, that's for me. Forty-five seconds and seven knots. That's-- How fast is that? It's medium on a home fan. Are you kidding? Oh, my goodness. Andrew, you're a true mastermind, an evil genius at the intersection of baking and engineering, the nucleus of this operation. You are a brilliant, Cambridge-educated aerospace engineer with an incredible expertise in baking. Combining those two worlds of baking and engineering, I came up with \"bakineering.\" Just like that. Tell us what these teams have to bake and build today. Each team will have nine hours to create their incredible, edible sailboat with a built-in servo and rudder system that they'll use to help steer it. What is a servo and a rudder? That lets us control the rudder. That's what we're gonna use to move it. Probably means it's remote-controlled. So they're gonna need it to steer, right? Oh, wow! That's amazing. Their boats have to be at least two feet in length and their boats will have to face the stress test that we've designed specifically for this mission. They'll have to sail their creations across nearly 20 feet of water in under 45 seconds. Whew! The vessels have to stay afloat if they wanna go the distance. This is a tough mission. Food isn't meant to float. So, we're demanding incredible ingenuity to make the impossible just about possible. From an engineering standpoint, basically, whatever we build, we just have to consider that we need buoyant force to be greater than gravity. And the force of the wind has to be greater than the friction force of the water against the boat. And it needs to be waterproof. Yeah, that's a critical detail. So the water doesn't get into the cake. I would say you could build the entire boat out of chocolate. Okay, why do you say that? It repels water. It's oil-based. And as long as the water is cold water, it won't melt. So, the only thing that I can think of that would float… Yeah? …is Rice Krispie treats with chocolate. If these boats are gonna survive, the first thing is recognizing that cake is usually not waterproof. A boat must be waterproof. We've got Dr. O, you're a Stanford-educated, PhD rocket scientist, astrophysicist and inventor with seven patents. Do you sleep? Power naps, man. Okay. I'm gonna judge it based on engineering. If it's not well-engineered, it won't survive. There's something called dead dough. In the cake world, it doesn't have any yeast in it. It has two types of flour, but it's so strong. We've got Chef Joanne Chang, one of the most accomplished and celebrated pastry chefs in the country. You've won a James Beard Award. You run nine successful bakeries. You've written five cookbooks. You also happen to be Harvard-educated. I decide if they pass or fail in the baking. I'm gonna be judging them on the taste. I'm so excited to see what they do with all of those ingredients that are back in the pastry kitchen. On top of having to make a functional boat that's edible, they also have to incorporate a dessert into the boat's design so we have something to taste. I think what we should focus on is what theme we want for our boat to be. Okay. What about… This is one of my favorite cakes that I've ever done. …a Willy Wonka-inspired candy boat? Like the candy man? Like the candy man. Instead of the drunk boat theme, 'cause it's so old-school, why don't we update it? Like a party boat? Yes. A party boat, since I'm from Miami? What about Medieval Renaissance? We could totally do it. How many sails though? If it has seven knots of wind, we could do two. I'll run to the pantry and grab some of the things I need. All right. Let's go, let's go. Pantry, pantry. How many trays of eggs do you need? Two. You definitely can't get these. See, this is why we have you. This is why we're together. Yeah. Measure out 30 ounces of marshmallows. All right. Said one tablespoon of butter? Take one tablespoon. Don't want too much fat. For Rice Krispie treats, it's not always precise. This is a horrible job. So do you think that this is going to weigh the boat down? I do, but given the volume of the boat, I think this isn't gonna be an issue. It's how to think of it. If our boat isn't heavier than water it's displacing… I like it. We're good. Perfect. Beautiful. You're officially a baker now. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That's all it took. Taylor and I are making a butterfly sailboat made out of dead dough, coating chocolate and rice paper. It's very strong. It doesn't have any yeast or anything in it, so it's very stable. What's that smell like? Oh. Like dough. I didn't wanna use Rice Krispie treats. Rice Krispie treats are really finicky with water and just moisture in general. This mold is inspired by if you were doing a carbon fiber layup, where the foam mold is foil and the carbon fiber is dead dough. As an engineering system, this has to float across the distance and has to be a certain size. I have to get on the table. This is awesome. So, it needs to be strong, it needs to be heavy, and it needs to be pliable and workable so we can get it into the shape we need, and dead dough checked all the boxes. Oh, that was smooth. Dead dough is so structurally sound. Careful, don't burn yourself. You could hurt somebody really bad with a really hard piece of dead dough. Cindy, Taylor. Hello. What's up? What's up? Nice to meet you guys. We've got some good energy flowing. Her cake artistry and my engineering skills are multiplicative, not summative. It's great. Tell us a bit about yourselves. I'm a little weirdo. I just like quirky designs. Look, I'm making a butterfly boat. Fantastic. What type of cake are you going to make for us? I am baking a vanilla chiffon cake, and it's going to have lavender-infused cream. And then some fresh blueberries, cut the sweetness. We're kind of playing on the theme of flowers and whimsical. Since butterflies, I'm pretty sure, like lavender. That sounds wonderful. I've been doing this for over ten years. My favorite aspect of it is connecting with my customers and also the decorating part of it. I remember, as a little girl, watching baking competitions. I was like, \"Okay, this is it. This is for me. I'm good.\" But coming from an Asian culture, you're taught to either be an engineer, a doctor, um, a lawyer, something that makes money. This competition is really important to me because I do want to inspire other little girls and I just want them to know that they can-- I'm getting emotional! Oh! I just want them to know that they can shoot for the stars. Oh, my God, why am I crying? Can we restart that? I don't know why it makes me emotional. 'Cause you care about them. Taylor? What's your background as an engineer? I normally work on electro-mechanical systems, but usually I do stuff that I describe as a creative technologist. Like how do people feel about the computer they use and the shape of the mouse, or the size of the window. I'm a mechanical engineer. I'm originally from Los Angeles. I knew I had an engineer's mind when I was little and I'd do mixing projects in the kitchen where I'd just take random things and see what happens when you put them together. The thing I like most that I've built recently is Cheeseborg. It's a grilled cheese-making robot. You ask it to make you a grilled cheese and it assembly-line-style pops out a grilled cheese, hot and fresh for you to eat. Can you tell us about how you're creating and engineering the boat? Yeah. This is dead dough. And is it heavy? Is it light? It is pretty heavy, but calculations have told us we have a lot of weight we can play with with this. Do you think it's gonna hold? Um, yeah, I'm not hesitating. I'm pretty confident with this. There was a little hesitation there. There was. So, this is gonna be our hull form. There's two of these for each hull. I'll cut these on the laser cutters and then bake them in that shape, help us get the Rice Krispies treats in the right shape. What is it made of? It's wood, so we can't get it too hot. Oh, shoot, I didn't know you could bake wood. That makes sense. You can as long as-- Yeah. Nothing's gonna catch on fire. We're going with a catamaran design, which uses two separate hulls. We'll have to build two boats. Twice as much work, but we think it's gonna be more stable. The cake is going to be this really moist, delicious, vanilla cake and it has this pineapple filling and a coconut rum wash, 'cause mama likes her cocktails. Just cuttin' with my laser I have power to the receiver, Steve. You do? Okay. That's great. We got a working rudder. All right. Steve and I are making a dual hull sailboat completely made out of chocolate. It's gonna be sushi-themed. Both of the hulls will be weighted so they're identical, then the sail will be made out of chocolate. The dessert portion of this boat is going to have a sushi theme to it, with Yuzu and passion fruit on a white chocolate mousseline, rolled in a genoise sponge. I'm actually heating up my eggs and sugar, so it's gonna whip quicker and give me the ribbon effect that I need for the sponge, okay? It's the Renee and Steve show I got my white gel coating chocolate. What are you gonna use that for? It works like glue. Excellent. That I understand. An edible glue. Alrighty, we have wings. Wing structure. We're going with a fantasy boat. We're gonna do a sea creature. In this case, a dragon. Wings are gonna open and close, like, \"caw-caw,\" you know? Okay, you make-- The noise makes me feel better. What we got here is a wafer paper. White chocolate in the middle to give it that natural bat-wing look. The servo motors are gonna allow the wings to open up 180 degrees. I'll hit you with the dessert. It's an almond cake. I'll fill it with apples and put it on a cookie dough shell with a little bit of rum glaze, touch of almonds, touch of apples, home run. I'm gonna Patrick Swayze these, baby. Yeah-- You can do it alone. We're not doing it like the movie. I'm gonna keep shaping the boat, and when I'm making progress, I'll call you over here to check it. Okay? Love it. What I'm gonna do with the dragon head, I'll make it sculpted then I'm gonna split it half because I need to run the tube. Okay. I don't know what to do about this back rudder part, though. I'll take care of that. I gotta start coating with chocolate. Explain to me the process of adding the rudder. What has to happen? Have to cut a channel. We're gonna make a Viking ship. The hull will be rice cereal treats, edible fabric to make the sail on the boat. For the delicious dessert, chocolate Viking hat cake pops with some bourbon pecans and butter cream. Man, you can smell that bourbon. Smells so good. If you need chocolate, it's here. Okay. Gonna use these wine bottles as support, which I probably should never say to my therapist. Okay. I'm gonna start gluing. Rodolfo and I are making a pirate ship, and it's going to be made with some rice rolls and chocolate and pretzels and pasta masts to hold it all up. And our dessert is going to be cannons. We're going more dark on the chocolate cake with a little brown chocolate mousse, and dark ganache with pistachios. And a little bit of orange zest. Yeah. So we can fight off scurvy. Ah, very good for an engineer. How do I tell if they're done? Randi, I need your expertise. Okay. No. Nope? All right. Swiss meringue buttercream is basically-- It's a meringue as well, but then you cook it 165, and then you add butter. That smells really good, Sierra. Yay! This is chocolate, but we're using it as glue. Being a bakineer is very hard. There are edible materials that I'm not familiar with. Right there. You see the fault lines? Right there. Easy, easy, easy. Good. Ooh, that was a critical point there. Like that? They feel clumsy, they are messy and they don't mix very well with electronics, but I'm sure we'll pull this off. Check this out. One eye, two eyes. No, not wrap. Like veins. Hold on. These are the eyes and then we coat. I'll coat first, and then we can think about cake and all that stuff. I am currently making a mold on Saran with rice cereal. Yes. All right. So… The question is, how do we make this thing stable enough with the bridge deck so it'll hold together? So I'm worried that we put this on here and then we have another piece on here. Yeah. It's just gonna fold up. The way they float, it's just not gonna-- That doesn't give me confidence that it'll hold together. Our original idea was catamaran. But I think we can do it with one hull. If we're making one boat, we have a boat. Do we really? Yeah. We put a mast in this thing. We don't have time to redesign a lot of stuff. You don't wanna make it a catamaran 'cause these are too big? Yes. All right. So then, my next thought is how to make it look attractive and where to put the cake. Forget the catamaran. We've gotta go with something new. It's time to pivot. So, we got to build a monohull. We're gonna pivot fast. I'm a little bit worried. We only have hours left, so for Sierra and Edwin to be doing a redesign at this point is really concerning. I think they're gonna be in trouble. I'm gonna go look for some candies, make it so it can just be a candy cake. We'll call it The Good Ship Lollipop. Cool. You like it? That's perfect. Okay. The back is definitely gonna fall off. The front is too. Oh, yeah. At first glance, it's not doing so hot. We probably made the dough thinner than we should have, but we didn't wanna make something too heavy. Okay, we got a big pop there. And down there. It's gonna break. Okay, then let's leave it down. Yeah. I say leave it, and then we'll do the-- Maybe we could even just do, like, a layer of chocolate and, like, move it to the fridge and let it set. Sure. I think-- Or modeling chocolate. I think we want something ugly and strong here and then we'll cover it. So what do you think? I kind of think isomalt. Isomalt acts like a thermoplastic. So, all I have to do is heat up basically molten sugar and it became this goopy dough. Kind of the spirit of bakineering, right? Something goes wrong, come up with a new ingredient or process using the isomalt to seal those cracks. It's what we wanna see from our teams. They're being ingenious, thinking on the fly, learning. I'm just gonna do it. I've always wanted to do this. We are down to four hours. Four hours. Oh, my gosh. In terms of integration, what's left? Okay, we have to build the middle hull and put the three all together. Okay. Rodolfo? How's it going? Yes, sir. Very good. What are you doing? Uh, so I'm cutting chocolate. I'm making the cabins of the pirate boat. Amazing. So, that's how I heated up the knife. Where are you from, Rodolfo? I'm from Brazil, but I'm living in New York for 17 years. Why'd you move to New York? -Seinfeld fan. -Seinfeld fan? Yeah, and I wanna live that dream. And here I am. I'm from Brazil. In 2004, I won the lottery for the green card. So, I came to America, to New York City, my dream city. I was a web developer, but when I got to America, I didn't find any job. Let's try to go 100% edible, okay? No structure. My first job was in a kitchen. I was so, like, mad. I study all my life, now I'm in a kitchen? But, uh, I felt in love with the-- All the process, how you make everything happen. I start baking around 2006 and then I started, little by little, building my business. Since then, right here, living the American dream. How's it going with Sara? Very good. Clicked right away. Hi. We're talking about you. Uh-oh, good things? Good balance. About the instant chemistry. Look, you're already beating each other up. Bakineer spouses. He's my work husband right now. Absolutely. Wok husband, work wife. That's right, you're my first husband. Ah! Sure. I have a wife. Chantelle is my lovely, amazing, beautiful wife. We will have been married ten years this coming New Year's Eve. I don't think I'm the easiest person to be with, but she manages to keep up and forgives. Doesn't maybe always forget, but forgives. She is the light of my life. Can't wait to see what you do. Thank you. I'll get out of your way. Thank you, man. Manuka, can you beatbox? No, but I can dance. Try it. Try beatbox. No, I don't know how to beatbox. You should beatbox, you can work while you do that. Look! That's gorgeous. Okay, I like it. Ooh, cool. Teams! Three hours left! We're taking on a lot of water. Let go. It's gonna capsize. We're too heavy in the front with the head. Gotta add weight to the back. There's a hole. That's bringing it up? 'Cause I feel unbalanced. It's balanced. She's not unbalanced. She just has a hole here. Let me check really quick. Okay. Well… Alrighty. There. That's why we test. It just started to absorb little by-- Like a sponge on the inside. Now, it's cased in chocolate. The chocolate looked great, but on the inside is where damage is. Almost like, I guess, termites eating away from the inside out. We have a major structural problem. This is where it got wet, from the skewers. Yeah. It's collapsing on us here too, Joey. All of this is bad. We need to restructure the bottom. Cover it with, uh, more rice cereal. Okay. All right. It seems like-- But, uh, we need to find something else for buoyancy. 'Cause you're gonna wanna put more. I wanna put more. We're noticing that the boat is heavy without any of your beautiful decorations on it, so we'll need some buoyant force. Do you think they have things not for baking but, like, cooking? Sausage? Sausage case? Yeah, we could blow them up like bladders. We found some sausage casings which you can blow up… …and they have some natural buoyancy. I'm gonna go for it. Oh, my God. They're like a giant, tangled, freakin' knot. So I can get some lift, and really hoping that the sausage casings on this side are the same buoyancy as on this side. Oh, look at this. That look gross. I don't know what this is. It is gross. You want me to make you one? I'm gonna make you a balloon animal. Ooh! Bakineers, time is ticking. Two hours left. Whoa! That was quick. Renee, come here. Cool spray from the front. Here? Where do you think is the best weight-wise to put this cake? Middle is good. If you put it on the sides, put it on both. Okay. How heavy is that cake? Uh… Maybe four pounds. Three pounds. Two pounds. I don't know. All right. Weight on top cancels weight on bottom. We gotta go with it. I think-- Okay. There's a decent chance it might tip over, but we're gonna make it beautiful. They may not catch wind, you know? Teams, only 30 minutes left. Wow. All right, turn the boat. Okay. Okay, so now I'm gonna put the cake back on. All right, judges, wanna head to the activation room? They seem ready. Let's do it. Bakineers, our illustrious brain trust is heading to get things prepared for the stress test. Trust me, a storm is a-coming. Rudder's working. That's perfect. And how sure are you that this is gonna float? After looking at the amount of weight that we have on top… Uh-huh. …I give us fifty-fifty. Come on, work with me, intestines. It actually looks like a sea monster. Now, when this goes up, will it hold enough weight? Wanna heat up some chocolate quickly? Yeah. Three minutes. No! Three minutes? We gotta finish. Batten down the hatches. Here goes. We have our sail. I-- Right. It broke. Lost the pagoda. Where's our temper chocolate? Grab the temper chocolate. Now it's crunch time. Let's get this thing done. Last touches. No, the other way. Last touches. There you go. The clock is ticking and the isomalt is melting. Go grab the batteries. Ten. Nine. Hurry up. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Gears up. Ganache down. Your time is up! Oh, my gosh. I wanna just cry. I think it looks absolutely gorgeous. Okay, teams. Follow me. Bakineers, are you ready to see the rough waters you'll have to weather? Yeah! Behold. Look at that! Whoa! Wow. Oh, my gosh. That is so cool. Ship is about to get real, guys. Bakineers, welcome to your very first Baking Impossible stress test, or as I like to call it, the Sea of Doom. I thought we were calling it The Motion of the Ocean? Propelled only by the wind and your hopes and fears, each of your boats must navigate all 20 feet and 6,000 pounds of this tank, from the start to the finish line, in under 45 seconds. You need to beware of uneven shoreline, the islands, the shipwrecks, Michael Phelps. So, good luck. Cindy, Taylor, you guys are up. We wanted our personality to shine in what we built. So, we landed on this sort of enchanted, whimsical fairy-tale, butterfly dreamboat. It is literally a hundred percent edible, except for the electrical components and the steering mechanism. We used some novel materials, like dead dough and rice paper, then more traditional materials, like fondant and modeling chocolate and isomalt also. It is time to see if your butterfly dreamboat will bring good or bad dreams. Put her in the water. Taylor is steering the boat. I can't even steer in a Mario Kart game. All right. My heart is beating so fast. Launch the fans in three, two, one. There she blows. Ooh! Goes. Yeah! Whoop! Oh! Oh! We're steerin'. Oop! We're still steering. Come on. You made it! Oh, man. So, as I look at your boat, clearly it performed hydrodynamically. Who actually designed the shape? The engineer? Yes. This was actually cast out of a positive mold. Mm. We did our best to get it uniform and horizontally and vertically symmetric. I think the way that the rudder performed showed that it was sufficient. Where you placed the rudder was absolutely perfect. Your boat performed very well. Let's taste it. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Of course. For our tasting, we have a vanilla chiffon cake, light and airy, just like butterflies, with a lavender-infused cream and fresh blueberries to give you some texture. Did you soak the chiffon with anything? Um, a little bit of honey syrup. Great. Justin finished his. Cindy and Taylor. I really love how this cake matches the boat. When we were talking about what kind of cake goes with a butterfly, dreamy, ethereal boat, we were thinking something light and airy, and you've done that with this cake. I think the texture of the sponge is really delicious and the blueberry has a nice little crunch to it and adds a little bit of acid. Thank you so much. Thank you. Cindy and Taylor, what I'm impressed with is your use of dead dough. It was really very stable in the water. To be honest, I was a bit concerned that those butterfly sails might have crumpled. They might have flown away. But they stayed stable. It went along the entire course. So, very well done. Thank you. Up next, Sara and Rodolfo. Judges, today, bakineers turn buccaneers. We went with a pirate theme. On this journey, we are being attacked by a sea creature, and, hopefully, it won't drag them to the ground. For the sails, we used wax paper with Flexique. For the mast, we have pastas covered in chocolate. Fondant on the sides and details in fondant. The base of the boat is made out of Rice Krispies with rice rolls as structure and cross braces out of pretzels, coated in melting chocolate. It has a Rice Krispie keel as well. And there are some sausage casings that were used as a buoyancy device and also are going to help balance out on the sides. Well, Sara, Rodolfo, let's release the Kraken. All right. Sara, Rodolfo, you have 45 seconds. Are you ready? Yes. Three, two, one. Oh, boy. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Ooh! Oh, God! Oh! Oh, no. Good job, guys. I'd like to say, even though it didn't function, there was some great engineering. I loved the shape of your hull. I loved your sails and I thought it was really clever how you added the monster to add extra buoyancy. Now, you were aware that you were top-heavy on your boat. When you have things that can lead to catastrophe, you want to build in a safety margin. A wider margin could've been very helpful for you. But we can still try your cake. Luckily, we had you save an extra piece of cake for us, in case your boat sank. Thank goodness. For the tasting portion, we're using a chocolate cake, a little rum, chocolate mousse, and a dark ganache with pistachios. Rodolfo, this is for the chocolate and the rum lovers out there. I do love that you've tied it in with the theme. You can tell these are little cannons sat on the deck. They didn't pop out. They blended in. Really well done. Thank you. I was really, really impressed with all of the level of detail of the design work. The cake is everything I want a sponge cake to be. The chocolate ganache shell is a little overpowering. If it had more of the pistachio flavor, then maybe it would add a nice balance. But it actually, for me, it overpowers the overall dessert because it's so strongly ganache. Thank you. Steve and Renee. We came up with the idea to build an exciting sushi boat with a very exciting sushi dessert. This boat is 99.9% chocolate. Andrew, if you wanna push the edible, this is about as far as you can go, minus the lights. Okay. Now it's time for the fun part. Let's see what floats this boat. Bakineers, you have 45 seconds. Three. Two. One. Go. Go. Go. Yes! Stay on the rudder. Okay. Oh, octopus. Hit the rudder. Oh, hit the rudder. Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I was-- Uh-oh. Oh, no! No! Oh, no! I'm sorry, that was my bad. I wasn't focusing. Uh-oh! All right. We're done. Steve and Renee, time is up. I'm curious, how did you guys decide who was gonna, uh, steer the ship? My engineer. I gave that up to her. I said, \"You got this, Renee. I'll make it float, you make it go down the stretch.\" She goes, \"I got it.\" But it didn't sink. Yeah! It's time to taste that sushi. Thank you very much. Tell us about what you've made us here. Basically, it's a genoise. It has a white chocolate mousseline infused with a passion fruit puree. Yuzu simple syrup, passion fruit caviar garnished with strawberries. Steve and Renee, I think the cake is really beautiful and very well-balanced. Really nice job tying in the tropical with the boat. I think, for me, I would like a little bit more textural contrast. Um, it starts to feel a little bit mushy. I feel like there could be another element in there, texture-wise, that'd bring this to the next level. Steve and Renee, I noticed you used a double hull design. When I look at your hull, the placement of your rudder, the shape of your sail, it suggests to me that perhaps someone on your team understands something about sailing. Correct. We both do, actually. There's a lot of physics with sailing, so I see that you understood the physics well. When you put it in the water, it floated perfectly, but it was operator error. Yeah. I was very excited. Steve and Renee, your sail, lovely and large. Using chocolate is a sensible choice in this case. Chocolate is waterproof, so deciding to make your entire boat out of that was a good call. It looked like it could've happily floated for hours. Thank you, Steve and Renee. Joey and Mario. In front of you, you have one of the most terrifying sea creatures. We decided to not make a very tall ship because we didn't want to compromise the center of mass. Let's put this sea beast in the sea. Fans are firing up in three, two, one. There she goes. Ah, it's over. No. It also doubles as a submarine. It could be the Loch Ness Monster. No. Oh, my God. Mario, I think that what happened with your boat was the weight distribution. They conspired to just make that guy just turn instantly. Ideally, you would weight the bottom of the boat and not have a uniform distribution of weight 'cause that moves the center of mass higher. We can control everything but nature. That wasn't nature. The dessert is an almond apple cake nested in a shortbread cookie dough tart shell, with a rum glaze, garnished with apple and sliced almonds. I do love all of the different textural elements of this cake/tart. Thank you. I love the almond flavor. I think there's a bit of a heavy hand with the cinnamon, and, from a presentation point of view, it'd be nice to have something a little more refined. Joey, Mario, from a bakineering point of view, I love your design. It was kind of majestic. A lot of great edible portions on there. I think when it came to your boat, your hull shape was probably a little bit on the round side. So if you imagine people running on a log, it has a tendency to spin. It's very sensitive stability-wise. So, I think you gave yourselves a tough challenge. Joey, Mario, thank you very much. Brandi, Menuka, you're up. It's a Viking ship. We decided to construct out of Rice Krispie and cover with chocolate and also try to use as much cinnamon as I can. Let's put this ship in the water. No! Oh! Nina and Hannah. This is a Renaissance boat. Very fabulous, very lovely. Randi, Jacob. And we're off. No. Come on, come on! Three. Two, one. Two, one. Time. Almost! So close! It was close. Bit shy. I mean, come on, that was really good. So, if your cake is incredibly delicious, you still might survive. Brandi, the cake is really rich. I love the textural elements with the pecans, but it was hard to eat the chocolate. Okay. Nina and Hannah, it was a little bit on the sweet side. I think something maybe a little bit acidic to cut through. Coming to your boat though, your hull is stunning. It does look like a model boat you'd see in a museum. Thank you. Randi, the flavors are delicious. I feel like the cake could use a little bit of a soaking syrup. I'd actually add a little bit more salt just to really bring out the mint and the chocolate flavors. Thank you guys very much. Vanessa, Shanice. Our sailboat today is actually 99% edible, so we're pushing the edible with this one. Let's start the party. Come on. Oh, my God. Yes! Come on! Come on! Yes! Whoo! Come on! As far as the hydrodynamics goes and the engineering, it was flawless. Thank you. Vanessa, we're excited to try the cake. It's really a lovely cake. The crumb is so fine. The filling is a little bit runny. I actually think taking egg yolk and making an Anglaise, instead of using corn syrup, just gives it a nicer flavor. From a design perspective, it looks unfinished. Overall, in terms of looking realistic, I think you could bring it up a notch next time. Thank you so much. Up next, Sierra and Edwin. Welcome aboard the Good Ship Lollipop. It's one of the first songs Sierra learned from her mother-- And love so much. Aww. Our boat is made out of Rice Krispies treats, covered with ganache and white modeling chocolate, and is propelled by a golden sail of seaweed and wafer paper. Let's go sailing. All right. It's heavy. She's a heavy one. All right. So you wanna-- Fire up the fans in three, two, one. Whoa! Oh! It's a hard no. Yeah. It's like Titanic with a keel. You know, Sierra and Edwin, I predicted, when I saw that cake in my head, that if that cake makes it a foot in that tank, I'm gonna be surprised. It hit the laws of physics. Because you had a solid Rice Krispie hull and you put a large mass on top, any movement to the side would move your center of mass, which was very high, from over your base. I think you realized this as soon as it went in the water, it was top-heavy. So, you perhaps should've thought a bit more about those bakineering materials. It really was up against the elements. It's a vanilla cake. It's soaked in a coconut rum simple syrup and then you have a pineapple filling and a salted coconut lime buttercream. Mmm. Sierra, this cake is so moist, really tender, really buttery. I like the freshness of the lime. I wish there was more pineapple. Yeah. I feel like that would've really helped counterbalance the sweetness. Using this kind of buttercream, the downside of it is it can be a little cloying. The one thing is, I didn't see a lot of variety in terms of pastry technique across your boat. I was hoping to see a little bit more in terms of different types of chocolate, maybe, or different types of sugar work. Something to really showcase your pastry skill. Sierra, Edwin. Thank you very much. Thank you. That was a blast. Good job, guys. Now, time for you to do your stress test. So, you go make a decision. I'll hang with you guys. I'm really heartbroken because I'm worried that I let Steve down. You learn from your mistakes. That's how most people get better. But this mistake could have cost us everything, but, hopefully, it didn't and we can move forward in a positive mind. You have a decision? We have a decision. Teams, follow me. For every team, we scored you with a pass and a fail in each of our disciplines, engineering, baking and bakineering. But there can only be one winning team. The winning team today showed us exquisite detail, a lot of bakineering skills, and sailed to success. And that team will be earning a big advantage in the next mission. And, unfortunately, the team that was least successful in today's mission will be going home. Just a reminder that you're all fighting for a chance to get to our final mission, and that only one team can win the $100,000 and the title of World's Best Bakineers. And the winning team who earns a colossal advantage in the next mission is going to be revealed by our cutting-edge cake-printing device. The winning team is… …Cindy and Taylor! Congratulations. Cindy and Taylor, your whimsy won the day. You engineered your boat to near-perfection. The hydrodynamics, the sails, the rudder design, you did it like it was easy. Yay! Congrats. Thank you. Which means, unfortunately, we have some serious business to attend to. Sadly, one bakineering duo from the losing course will be going home today. It's come down to two teams, and for our judges this was actually a very tough decision. Sierra and Edwin. And Joey and Mario. Sorry to say, but based on our judges' scoring, both of your teams failed the mission today. The team going home today is… …Sierra and Edwin. I'm so sorry. This was your final mission. You did good. It's okay. Yeah. Thank you. It was wonderful that you were able to pull together and collaborate to get that final design, but, sadly, your change of design meant that your boat was unstable from the beginning and you didn't have time to test. Your boat was just too heavy. It was doomed to fail as soon as it hit the water. Thank you. Thank you so much, guys. Bye, guys. It's been an absolute pleasure and an honor to bakineer with you guys, and especially with you, Sierra. Thanks, Eddie. I'm feeling emotional, but I think failure is one of our greatest teachers. No one ever wins without failing. It's just been-- It's been a great time. We had so much fun. I mean, such a unique opportunity and experience. I'm not gonna stop bakineering. I mean, once I've tasted it, I'm hooked. Yay! Cindy and Taylor, congratulations. You earned an advantage for the next mission, which I will tell you soon. Guys, we'll see you for the next mission where someone's gonna be doing the robot. Show them the robot. That's-- Okay. We're gonna work on it. And that next mission is gonna start right now.

Six talented pastry chef pairs will face off in a race against the clock and against each other to prove who's best. Oh, look. It's falling. Again. I have to repeat it. They will have 24 hours in total to bake throughout the entire season, in which, episode after episode, they must prove their talent in delicious challenges. We have to get it up. No. We're wasting time. Teams that fail to win over the judges will be eliminated. In each episode they will be able to use up to six hours over two rounds. The first, cupcakes and creations. The second, ah, cakes. But it will be the taste and their creativity that will determine which of these teams will win a million pesos and the winning trophy! I'm Capi Pérez, and these are our judges. Gris Verduzco of Mis Pastelitos. The pastry chef who has revolutionized the social media world with her sweet recipes and cake challenges. Luis Robledo, the famous pastry chef and award-winning Mexican chocolatier who never ceases to amaze the entire world with his creations. And as a guest judge, Erika Buenfil, one of the most recognized faces of Mexican soap operas of all time. Gris Verduzco is explaining to our pastry chefs what the first round of challenges consists of. The theme, street food. She is also warning them that at the end of this round, two teams will lose 30 minutes of their remaining time to make their cake. Wow, this is gonna be rough. There's no going back now. Run! Because this sound indicates that the sweetest race has just begun. Follow me. Hello, friends. All set over here? Ready. That's the right attitude. Very good. All good here? All good! Very good. You ready? We're ready. Yep, ready. All set. We're gonna win. Love it. Good luck. Thank you. Judges Gris, Luis, what a pleasure to have you. And what an honor to have my idol here, the legend, my spiritual mentor, Erika Buenfil. Truly. Thank you. Thank you for being here, Erika. How do you feel? Very excited. It shows. My dear Gris, what does this first challenge consist of? Well, in this street food challenge… Okay… …what the pastry chefs have to do is create the perfect breakfast to go, but in a cupcake. But wait! To make this challenge more special… Special, oh! When you see it live, it feels more amazing. Different, different. This cupcake must be inspired by your favorite typical Mexican breakfast. Imagine all the possibilities. I like to have some chilaquilitos for breakfast, with some bread. About two fried eggs. All that inside a cupcake? Sweet? If that tastes good, of course. What's your typical breakfast? Green chilaquiles. You cannot forget cheese, cream. Mixers there, mixers here. If we run into each other, I'll kill you. Okay. There is nothing more Mexican and chilango than a tamale sandwich. Are you nervous? No. I'm revved up. We're going to surprise them with this deconstruction of the tamale, with the corn and everything. You like the idea, right? For it to be like this? Yes. I like the idea of it being… A hot cup of coffee. With bread and everything. Careful. I almost punched my partner! Oh my gosh! We are going to make a cupcake inspired by churros with hot cocoa, which is also very Spanish. It's been 10 minutes. Ten minutes? That's a lot of time. We plan to make a cupcake that is a sweet tamale. Let's give it our all. Okay, pour some here. Okay. If you need me to move, tell me. Come on, Ruth! Can I help you? You set? I'm gonna risk making a bolillo dough. A tamal sandwich without its special bread, well, that's not right. I've participated in professional competitions nationally and internationally. That has opened the doors to another vision of pastry that I didn't know. I'm taking a risk, Ale. I don't want to go home today. No. No, neither do I. We're a team. He trained me. The truth is that I consider him as a teacher. I'm helping you make the, uh, pink chocolate montage. That's okay. Okay. I see her as a little sister. I brought her into my pastry world. To the oven. Works good as a fermenter, huh? Alan is proofing dough in the oven. They have to wait for it to rise. Yeast dough needs heat and foam. Risky, huh? Because that takes time. We're somewhat ambitious. But I don't like being ordinary. Come on. I don't know how long we've been. Oops, my word! I haven't looked at the clock until now. Let's not forget that after this first round, which is not only cupcakes but also creations, the two bottom teams will lose 30 minutes for their round of cakes. That's right. I love tamales, you know… Let me come closer. I can't hear you. I'm busy here. …and chilaquiles. But I know that yours, your favorite, are the tamale sandwiches. Luli is my mom, and she's my best friend. Am I in the way here? No. I was feeling a little lonely. When I had a heart attack, I was very depressed because they told me, \"You won't be able to do anything else except sit down.\" Luli, the ganache. I left it in the freezer. And she coaxed me. She coaxed me into baking pies. To bake cakes. Look, they turned out good. They came out well. They turned out very nice. And that injected life into both of us. Watch out. Cupcakes ready. You know what? I also have to moisten the tamale leaves. Cream is almost there? As a child I loved very elaborate cakes, and no one made them. So I promised myself that when I grew up, I would be the best pastry chef so that no child would lack an incredible cake at their party. Yes, I like them. Perfect. It smells like a tamale. In fact, smell them. Ah! I started with the pastry part because I love trying new things. When he goes to the pastry shop, I give him something different to try. That's why I go. What's up, Karen? It's already been 45 minutes. Come on! Let's start with the churros, guys. Erika, shall we tour the facilities? Yes! Let's go, so you can chat. I would love that. There can't be one lump in this cream, because then the presentation will be spoiled, huh? When I was studying, there was a professor who gave me pastry classes. He told me I was not going to be able to live off of making pastries, ever. We need the cream cheese to sit, right? For the filling. Pineapple tamale with cream cheese. Great. Professor, I know you're watching me. Don't change the channel, because you're going to see us succeed. Israel, Iván, nice to meet you. I present Erika Buenfil. Pleasure. What's up? I'm watching you. She has such beautiful eyes. Guacamole color. It's a pineapple compote. You can smell it. It has a little bit of cinnamon. Have you heard the term pineapple jam, or no? No. My jam. Hey! He is my jam. We're jamming. Right behind you. I'm gonna do it by sight. We're already plating and Gaby is giving the final touches to our frosting. All that remains is to add our sauce, the tortilla chips and the cheese. I'm excited. The first ones are already finishing, no? Karen and Gaby. They're there. They want to take our pie. This game is interesting but complicated, because they only give us 24 hours for the entire season. It's six hours per episode. But we can't use all of them because we have to save time for the finals. Each episode is divided into two rounds. The first part is cupcakes and creations. And the second round, we have to bake a cake. It doesn't matter if we manage to do perfect things. If we run out of time, we're out. Enjoy watching us suffer. Done, Gaby. Whoo! And they're done. Karen and Gaby are done with the cupcake challenge. When do they press the button? When they both finish? When they both finish. Yes, both. The cupcake and the creation. Then you can press it. My friend, master Luis, what does the creations challenge consist of? Their creation will be inspired by street food. A tortilla sandwich. It can be a taco, a tlacoyo, a tamale. A sweet tlacoyo? Sounds even poetic. Let's make gorditas. Okay. Cream. Uh-huh. Nice. We finished first. That gives us a time advantage for our second challenge. Damn. There it is. Go. Let's go with dessert, right? With the creation. Come on, Gaby. We're doing great. For the sweet creation part, we're gonna make some corn salad. I'm gonna use these cups as a mold to make some chocolate cups, okay? Yeah. Get in. It had too much ganache on the tip of the piping bag, and it's clogged. It looks like Lis and Luli are battling with the ganache. I'm gonna do the ganache with a spoon, Lu. Lis, what if we use a bigger piping bag? If you want, but it's clogged. The problem with a very cold ganache is that it does not have a very good consistency to be able to place it on the cupcake. No, Luli, don't put… Are you sure, honey? Yes. Do it like that, Lu. What if it's faster? Come on. There, they already plated. They already have their cupcakes. Them too. I know we're worried about Alan and Ale, but good news, they're putting mini breads on top of their cupcakes. Mini bolillos on top of their cupcakes. Four for the judges. Done. Let's go to the next one. Ready. Rubí. Okay. The churros turned out really well. Really well. Yeah. That's the way, Ruth. Where is the Manchego cheese, Rubí? Below. In the drawer. For the creation, we are very inspired by flautas. Stuffed corn tortillas. Powdered sugar. The first thing that comes to mind for me is a fried quesadilla. With everything, my friend. I think we're gonna make something super crunchy, like flautas. We are going to simulate, with filo pastry, that crunch in… in our flautas. I think the dough was also a little runny. I'm feeling pressure because I'm doing gorditas, and they aren't looking good. Well, these have to be taken out already. Hey, their pastries are burning. Do you think it's possible to split these for-- Oh! Be careful! We thought that we had a lot of time ahead for having finished the cupcakes earlier, but it's not turning out as we would've liked. Pastry chefs! Remember that the two teams that do not convince the judges will lose half an hour in the next challenge. I don't know which is better anymore, to plate and get punished over time, or to continue here wasting time. They all have to look the same, okay? You're right. I'm not in a good mood anymore. The piping bag is clogged. It's impossible to work like this. Luli, now. Ready. We have to speed up, Luli, we're 30 minutes late. For our sweet creation, we plan to make a corn on the cob. And we'll make it so the judges can pick it up and eat it. They started using liquid nitrogen. There, there, there. I'm giving it-- Stir it. Move it. Don't get injured. I'm surprised they don't have gloves. Nitrogen burns badly. It's -73 degrees. Wow. Yes, yes. No, no, no, no. Careful, dude. Time is forcing us to hurry up, isn't it? Do I start plating them? Yes, please. Get ready. They're almost there. We are almost ready for the first one. They're about to… Ready! Bravo! They pressed the button. Someone's finished? Israel and Iván are done, dude. We have to shift gears. Let's go try, what do you think? Let's go. Come on. Israel, and Iván, how are you? Hey. Let’s start with the cupcakes. The cupcake, we think, is the breakfast that every Mexican should have at least once in his life. Sure. A tamale with corn flower. And we put a touch of pineapple there, with a compote. What's this? Wow! It has a good balance of flavors. Everything they said is there. The cream is a little too sweet for me. Okay. Tell us about your creation, please. That one is inspired by corn salad, and it's hot corn milk. Inside the dessert you'll find poblano chili cream, corn biscuit, citrus compote, and a cream that we made from yogurt, simulating the cheese part. It looks spectacular. The yogurt, what they did, the show they gave us… We were seeing what they were doing with the nitrogen. We create our own tricks The only thing is that I almost don't like spiciness, and maybe I would add less chili. Yes. Damn it. I do like spicy, so I did look for this flavor that for me was a surprise in a dessert. Very good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Come on, girl. Come on! Sorry to interrupt you, friends, but Ruth and Rubí are done too. There's some strong competition here, huh? I'm gonna tackle them. No, no. Calm down. Well, two out of six, it's not that bad. Ruth and Rubí. Tell us more please, starting from here to there. Our cupcakes are a typical Mexican breakfast of churros with chocolate. The dough has a bit of cinnamon. The center has metate chocolate. And we've also moistened, let's say, the domes with butter to overflow them a little with sugar and to remind us a bit of a churro bite. The only thing I would've liked in the cupcake… is if the cream was a little sweeter. Okay. It tasted milky to me. So tragic. Go ahead with the creations, please. Well, our creation is some flautas filled with Manchego diplomatic cream and bits of yellow guava jelly and a tile which is not very… Well… It's crunchy and sweet. It's from Manchego cheese. That was our special touch. I love flautas. They're sour, sweet, crunchy, and they're playful. I did like that salty touch. It was a surprise to me. Very good, congratulations. Great! Great. And you grated cheese. It looks great. Mmm, it's still very hot. If the bread doesn't cool down enough, we can't handle it. And don't you think it'll cool faster if we put them in like this? I'm already feeling pressured. I'm getting nervous. I dropped it, Lis! What happened? I'm not paying enough attention. Careful. Go press the… Okay, perfect. Last touches. All the pieces are already on plates. Go, go, go, go. Ready? Press it! Done! I don't know whether to laugh or cry anymore, Lu. I'm not gonna cry because tears are salty, and if they fall on dessert, they're going to be ruined. Look, it's a good thing I didn't eat what was left over. I am very distressed because everyone is finishing and we're not moving forward. One, two, three, let's go. I'll give it a minute, Lis, and I'll take it out. Karen and Gaby, how are you? Tell us about the cupcake first. It's a vanilla cake. It has a cheese frosting. Then, we made a green tomato jam with a little serrano. And it also has a pistachio sauce with white chocolate. Here's the jam. You paid a lot of attention to the challenge. I love how they combined everything. The green chilaquiles, the cream cheese from the icing. Very good. Congratulations. Thank you. I needed more tomato jam, and I was looking for it, but it tasted very good. Very good. Now let's hear about your creation. We were inspired by a pambazo sandwich… Yes. …so we tried to make some gorditas with apple fondue, feta cheese and a little bit of cream. It also has a fig jam and smoked chili. It's spicy. That one is a bit spicier. Mm-hmm! I was expecting something a little neater. However, the flavors seem to be on point. It lost the charm in the presentation, but in terms of taste, it already made up for everything else. Thank you. Congrats, girls. Cut it, cut it. Come on. I see chaos in Lis and Luli's kitchen. They're all done. You made bread! Alan and Ale, tell us about it. Ours is made up of a sweet tamale, a pink tamale, and as decoration we have a bolillito. If you pick up the bolillo, you'll find a little chocolate sauce to dip the little bread. And you'll notice that it falls apart just like a tamale. It's like a… Yes, like a tamale. I felt that by wanting it to taste like a tamale and making a different recipe, maybe it was a little cakey. Have you never tried a tamale cupcake? Now tell us about your creation. Some flautas. We were inspired by an apple strudel. Only we used plantains. We used filo dough to simulate the flautas, and the guacamole is made with a pistachio pastry cream. Amazing. I would have tried to find something other than rice paper for the lettuce. It doesn't add flavor or anything. Okay. Fine. The filling is very rich. I wanted it to taste like an omelet and nothing. It was a dessert. Very good. Thanks, guys. Thank you. I'm anxious, but they look very tasty. I don't want to lose 30 minutes. You have to press the button. Done! We were last. But I'm confident that the next round, we will be first. Dany and Ana Lau. We wanted to make a cupcake that had the exact flavor of café de olla. We put an orange cream on it also to counteract all those strong spices. In addition, we wanted to add a mini cookie bread, and we also made some jars with almond marzipan. They put cream inside. Yeah. All right. No, no. What a delicious thing. The cupcake did taste like coffee. Maybe the cream was a little greasy for me, but it was very good. The shell, too. All the time you invested doing this was worth it, girls. Thank you. Now let's move on to creations, please. We wanted to make some quekas. It's the typical fried quesadilla with sauce and cream. Obviously everything is sweet. And that's some yogurt corn with cream and a touch of sugar. We made it more balanced, you know? We decided to… We wanted it not so sweet. You forgot one ingredient. The salt. Ah. That contrast, that would've raised the flavor much more than what you expect. Oh, man! A touch of salt, maybe you're right. I would've loved it, but it's very tasty. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Lis and Luli. Hello. Tell us about your cupcake first. This is a cupcake that's like a sweet tamale, and is filled with cheese and blackberry. The topping is a chocolate ganache, and on top we have a tamale sandwich made of chocolate. I'm so nervous. It's a shame the ganache is cold. Yes. Temperature. Change the experience. It was hard to cut. Yes. Good. Tell us about your creation. You can pick it up. Let's see, let's see. Let's turn it around. We made a recipe, a family recipe, which is corn bread, and we also made a vanilla panna cotta, and the topping is cheese. The taste of the corn… I feel that perhaps it was too much, that if they had counteracted it more with the chili, it would've been even tastier. Okay. Each grain of corn looked as if it were on top of a cob. Congratulations, very good. Thank you. I hope the corn does help and saves us in this round. Pastry chefs, the judges have already talked. Everyone did a great job. However, there was one team that stood out for their creativity and the interactive way of testing their creations. Iván and Israel! Give each other a hug! Hello, Professor. Now, the bad news. Two teams will lose 30 minutes for the cake round. The first team wanted to use a lot of elements that unfortunately didn't work well together. Ruth and Rubí. We can't believe it. No. As for the second team, the pressure, the tension and the stress they suffered in the first round did not help them. Lis and Luli. Luli! We just lost 30 minutes. The time has come to start the second and final round! The cakes! Let's listen to my idol, Erika Buenfil. For the last challenge, you will have to create a cake that looks like a dish or a Mexican street food stand. What do you think? The hardest part of this challenge is getting the cake to have a realistic finish. But first, let's review the most important ingredient in this program. Time. Israel and Iván will lead with four hours, 18 minutes and 29 seconds. while Lis and Luli will be the last to start with three hours, 15 minutes and 31 seconds. And that's where I'll let you know as time progresses, so that the others can start. And I'd like to remind you to save some time for the final. If you make it, of course. Okay, Capi. Hands on the mixers. Your time begins now! So we're gonna do the taco griddle, right? With the dome. And we're gonna add the meat, chorizo, a little onion. They'll find Irish cream, chocolate and coffee flavors. How much will we have earned from that million, now that we have this extra time? I would say 10%, 20%. Ten, 15%. Even though Iván is my friend, right now, I hate you. Almost there. Almost there, huh? Yeah, we'll be right behind you. I'll catch up with you, Iván. Time does play a little with your mind, because it begins to torment you. Karen and Gaby, hands on the mixers! Your time starts now! Okay, we're going to do, like, these pots that the ladies have. Street vendors. Lots of snacks. Peanuts. Our cake is inspired by a street chip stand. It's going to be lemon. We're gonna put a lemon cream filling with a tamarind pulp and grasshopper powder to make it a little more interesting. That's the last one. Ah! Go! We're all looking at Iván and Israel. I don't like to see what they start to make, because it puts a lot of pressure on me. One, two… They're ready. We want to start. Our hands are like this. Alan and Ale, Dany and Ana Lau, hands on the mixers! Your time begins, now. Let's do some corn salads. Okay. White glass, chocolate spoon, and a chicken leg, because the more the street-style, the more atmosphere. It's gonna have a lot of corn. A lot. They're looking for realism, and I want to give that expression on our cake. I'm gonna speed up the process and make twice the amount for the mixture. This time, Ale is gonna take the lead as head chef, and I am going to be her sous chef. I'm going to make a super traditional corn cake. I'm going to make a passion fruit toffee and an apricot jam. How's it going, Chef? I'm cooking all the jam. Okay. I hope to be prepared to take charge this time. I dominate more, regarding the fondant part. A little thicker? More cooking time? Yeah, a little more. Okay. I say we make a taco stand with a taco man. Do you like it? And he's gonna have his pot, his plate, his sauces, He's gonna be named Don Pancho, yeah? Yeah. Okay, we have 18 eggs. I'm gonna separate them. For the cake we'll use jamaica, horchata. They're going to make a delicious cake because it's gonna have jamaican gelée. Yeah. How are you doing, Gaby? Ready, chef. I'm done. Chocolate. Yeah. Capi is coming over. Oh, no. Pastry chefs, not to add more pressure, but I want to remind you that after this round, one team is going home. We have to hurry. Here we go. Come on. I'm getting desperate. Oh my God. I want to start now. I tried to put two recipes in the mixer, but it didn't fit. The first thing I need to do is start mixing the recipes I already have without forgetting what I added. That is essential. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Ruth, Rubí, hands on the mixers! Your time begins, now! We're gonna make a pot of tamales, okay? A pot of tamales. Yes. And the table will be as if it were a small dinner, and a plate with more tamales. What do you think of the sauce? I love it. A mortar? A mortar. We're going to make a corn cake, and we're gonna add caramel sauce and a crispy caramelized walnut. I miscalculated. I'm incorporating all my elements already mixed by hand. I see that being so ambitious to make so many recipes at the same time is slowing me down a bit, and it was exactly what I didn't want to do. Ready. Okay. I don't like to wait for anything. I don’t have the patience. I'm anxious to see that everyone is starting and that we still can't do anything. Lis and Luli. How are you? Uh… nervous. You have to make an exceptional cake. That's the goal. Yes, to stay here. I don't know how we're gonna do it, but we have to give it everything we have. How are the others doing? Do you know? Lis hasn't started yet. Ruth and Rubí are barely mixing. They're already making decorations. You need something? Yes. Now! Now! Go. Let's go! Lis and Luli, your time begins, now! Let's do this. Everyone is competing right now. For this round, we're going to make a cake in the shape of a pastor meat trompo, and we're gonna put an oven on it. We're also going to add some fatty meat on the side. What flavor for this? -Jamaica with tequila? -Jamaica with tequila. And tequila may help the judges to be happy and vote in our favor. Yes, for us. This one has to be baked while I take out the other one. Let's just put a little here… Pastry chefs! You have two hours and 20 minutes left to finish your cake. Save a little time for the finale. If you make it that far. Well… Well, we need a miracle. How are you, Ale? Good. Ah, that's what I wanted. How do you feel? Uh… I have a mental block. Toffee done. Jam, you checked the texture? I'm not listening to Alan. How do you feel? Huh? Don't know? Conflicted. Really? I feel Ale is very tense. She's getting short with me. How can I help you? No, no, no, no. But achievable? Yes, I hope so. He's trying to help me, and I think it's generating more pressure for me. What's bothering you? The base? The filling? It's fine. You're making things quicker. Oh, okay, sorry. Damn… Ooh… Calm down. Calm down, all right? So I can be calm. Do they look angry? Yes. Okay, I'll relax. I know that Ale, at some point, was Alan's assistant. so I don't know if the hierarchy issue is playing against them. First solve the issue, then discuss it afterwards. That's what a professional does. Hey! There's our little man. Right now, Isra, you make the iron pan to paint… Yeah. …and I'll handle the coriander. Israel and Iván had the advantage, and I feel like they haven't taken advantage of that, and they haven't made that much progress. I'm not gonna leave it so smooth because in the end it's gonna be covered. Luli, what do you think? I'm cutting the bread to place it in the structure. Is that good? Perfect. It's a 3D cake and has a specific structure. We have to fight gravity a bit so it doesn't fall. What do we think of Lis and Luli? Looks like they're really hitting the gas. Right now it's obvious, but like this… Super concentrated. Tunnel vision, right? Totally. Okay. Is it sticking or not? I think so. A very interesting detail of our cake is the edible plastic bags that look like real ones. Put some bags on it. Even more of, of the fried foods, okay? Edible plastic bags? I like those innovative techniques. Don't use so many. It doesn't take that many. Well, I only pick this… this part. They look like surimi tacos. Yeah but wait. More here, here, here. No, here, here. If we make mistakes, this is going to get complicated. Pastry chefs! There's an hour and a half left. Remember that in the end, we will know which team will lose the opportunity to win a million pesos. We're gonna win if it kills us. We already decided. Let them bury us with the million. It's like you give it the shape and then, let me explain, to stimulate… You can still lose some more of it. It's already taken shape. We're in the final stages to deliver it and we still have time on the clock. Ready. Go. Press it. Yay! And they touched the button. They already pressed it? What? No way. Pressing that button, for us, already represents success. Anytime, huh, dude? Wait, I'm just… The meat'll cool. Why are they not touching the button? Who? We press the button? The rest is not finished yet, huh? It's all right. Good, yeah. Calm down. I see the cakes that are finished. It's starting to make me doubt if what we're presenting is correct. It looks like a pot. Stop that. What I'm focused on is that mine is tasty. I don't care about the others. Well, I think what… Don Pancho looked like a child. We've already competed together, already won, so we're gonna give our all. Let's hit the button! Hit the button! Let's go! They already pressed it, Mom. Ana and Dany. It looks like cheese. Go, go, go. To me, it looks like a cup of corn, and whoever says otherwise, I wouldn't believe it, but I notice Ale is very overwhelmed. And I don't like that. Go. The button, the button. Okay, we're gonna push the button. Come on. Let's go. Rubí! We're the last ones, again. We're the only ones left. We need this to fit very well. Right now is when we need more concentration, and something always happens. Don't trip, Lis. It would be serious if this anti-gravity cake fell. I hit it a bit. Ugh, my nerves. Like that, Lu, yeah. Done? Okay. Yeah. Done! Wow. I wanted to jump! Hug me, Luli! Ready. Karen and Gaby, the first to finish. Congratulations. Thank you. Thanks. As you can see, the judges are here, and they'd like to know what we're looking at. Our concept is inspired by the junk food street carts, or rather chip carts, that we see on every corner. The plastic bag looks just like plastic. Yes. I can give you one. They sound real. Honestly, using this technique is really impressive. And they had never worked together, so it's magic. Thanks so much. Israel, Iván, explain to the judges your concept, please. When Isra and I met, we did a lot of things all day, so all we could find for lunch and dinner were tacos. It has it all. Meat, sausage, onion, nopal. You think it's salty, and that's the secret of this challenge. And now I think that the flavor will determine it. Let's hope they cherish our memories. Please. We wanted to make the classic taco maker. Don Pancho, we called him. The way they modeled the face, that technique they have is impressive. The only thing I see, because I see it like this… It shows here, how they pasted the fondant. But I feel that with more time, it would have been perfect. I want Don Pancho to serve me some tacos. Really, congratulations. Thank you! This challenge is ours. One woman from the north is worth two. Is worth two. Alan and Ale, I see a controversial chicken hand. Tell us about it. We used a lot of chocolate techniques. Both the spoon and the corn, as well as the mayonnaise. Yes, I think the chocolatier techniques are obvious. They represented the cake in white. Exactly. I saw they were thinking about it, and it is a cup of corn. I would've liked something more elaborate. I needed a little bit more theatrics. But hey, it's the esquite cup with the lemon on the side. Let's get along better, guys. Because cooking is done with passion, so when you're displaying adverse emotions, it doesn't help. That's how things go in the kitchen. Thank you. Thank you so much. The concept is a tamale street cart. The anti-gravity effect you gave is what draws attention from afar. And that the cover is like this. Beautiful. Creative. Congratulations on the mortar, because over there I said, \"Why didn't anyone make a mortar?\" Thank you, really. Thank you. We did it, Ruth. Take that! Hey, Luli. Tell them about your concepts and techniques, please. Well, our concept is tacos al pastor, because we like them a lot. I really like the color, the details. The work, the effort is clear. The detail of the oven lacks just a little bit, right? Yeah. Like some coal burning. Although they make up for it with that wow effect of the light. Congratulations. You guys showed up for this one. A round of applause. Thank you. Thanks. Now it's time to cut four slices and take them to the judges' table, because the flavor is key. Great. My dear Karen and Gaby, please bring your slices. Winning a million pesos would be incredible. Wish us luck. Fingers crossed. Tell us what flavors you added here. The cake is lemon-flavored, with a lemon cream. And we also added tamarind pulp and a touch of grasshopper powder. Grasshoppers. Really? I just ate some grasshopper? Yes. I think their decision will be very good for us. It's a good cake, aesthetically and in taste, so… And very striking, right? You're gonna find flavors of Irish cream, chocolate and coffee. In the filling, we put a cookie to give it that contrast of textures, and also a very rich chocolate touch. I'm very nervous, but something deep inside tells me, \"Calm down.\" Baked cake, glitter inside and salt outside! Our cake is inspired by street flavored water, which is jamaica water and horchata water, so we made a cake that's gonna be slightly moistened, and on the side it will have… A jamaican gelée that has a lot of texture. The competition is fierce. A lot of talent. There is a lot of talent. We're very nervous, because a small detail can make a difference. Well, what you'll find here is a very moist cornbread, with a fine batter of Swiss meringue and butter, and caramel sauce. Also filled with caramelized walnuts and covered with chocolate ganache. That's it. The dice have been rolled. Yeah. We feel like it's very close because all the cakes are pretty. The cake is jamaica, and it also has a hibiscus extract to moisten it. And the frosting is cheese with red fruit compote. I am very nervous, and I hope the verdict is positive. The most important thing is the taste, the texture. I'm hoping for the best. Well, what we have here is a cornbread that is inspired by my family's recipe. With an apricot jam and a soft passion fruit caramel, which goes very well with the acidity and the corn. I hadn't felt anguish up to this point because silence is the most brutal thing there is. Pastry chefs, the judges have made a decision. The team that is chosen as first place will win one extra hour to compete in the finals. And the team that is chosen as second will have half an hour too in the finals. That is, if they make it. My dear idol… …would you do us the honors of naming the team that came in second for this challenge? The pair that won second managed to tell a story that matched very well with their presentation as well as with their flavors. Dany and Ana Lau. We're gonna give Erika a loyalty card from Don Pancho. Second place is very nice, but it's not as sweet as first. This next team won because of their strength, because of their presentation, and because of their flavor. The team that won first place is… Lis and Luli. After that, Lis, we have to take a sabbatical year. We deserve it. Didn't you see it coming? No. We thought we were gonna lose. Oh, no. Aw, sweetheart. You kept it together. You did a great job. You have earned an extra hour that you badly needed for the finals. If you make it, of course. We will. There are things that are much more valuable than winning, and one of them is being able to have my mom here with me. Very good. It's time to find out who are the two teams that presented the cakes that the judges liked the least. The first pair is… Alan and Ale. Come forward, please. Please don't eliminate us. We both have a lot to prove. The second team that also failed to win over the judges is… Ruth and Rubí. It's the first day, you know? First day. Being nominated on the first day… I am now going to ask you, judges, to tell us, with your vote, which team should leave the competition. Let's start with you, Gris. Although the cake was very delicious, I feel the technique they used, in the end, did not give an excellent result. My vote goes to… Alan and Ale. I'm about to cry. To me the cake had an excellent presentation, but when it was time to taste it, I found it to be very sweet, and lacked harmony. My vote is for… Ruth and Rubí. No, no, no, no. Luis, my friend, all that remains is to hear your defining vote. Tell us, please, who should leave Sugar Rush: The Baking Point. I don't like being the executioner, but hey, it's up to me to give my vote, and since it's a very high-level competition, those details are what makes the difference. So my vote goes to… Hands on the mixers! Your time starts now. We cannot fail today. It's about beating time. A piñata cake… A Day of the Dead offering. You have to change and improve. Yuck! You were given an awful cake. An impossible pastry. Scandalous! What are you doing? How awful. The team who'll be eliminated is… I think it'll make it special. Special. You switch it every five minutes! I know. Finish your cakes! Hold it. That's what I think. Come on, Lis! I'm sad to see you go. A million pesos! Enjoy our suffering.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-PG","Word Count":6531,"Year Published":2023,"Season & Episode":"S01E01"},"example_id":"2eb81d2f-6fd0-42d2-9516-f1c7a19f72e8","annotations":[{"end":49,"tag":"Perceptual","start":42,"value":"playful","tag_id":"3302eb94-c347-42d4-a94e-fa696faadced","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"2eb81d2f-6fd0-42d2-9516-f1c7a19f72e8","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:48:37.91+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T04:38:27.849+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:38:51.93+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"cb308f5d-d49a-4a7f-bfe8-5d6bdf087d3f"},{"end":28,"tag":"Perceptual","start":21,"value":"crunchy","tag_id":"3302eb94-c347-42d4-a94e-fa696faadced","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"2eb81d2f-6fd0-42d2-9516-f1c7a19f72e8","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:47:44.378+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T04:38:27.848+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:38:57.41+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"daec552a-a2aa-4a5b-9329-4dfd164b5d71"},{"end":38,"tag":"Biological Kind","start":34,"value":"they","tag_id":"b3c56c74-2d45-483d-945d-9103cf870c36","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"2eb81d2f-6fd0-42d2-9516-f1c7a19f72e8","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:47:44.378+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:39:04.416+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T04:38:27.849+00:00","annotator_id":5}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"cbcb6590-9982-4a7e-a7cc-699cb07cc5a9"},{"end":12,"tag":"Perceptual","start":8,"value":"sour","tag_id":"3302eb94-c347-42d4-a94e-fa696faadced","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"2eb81d2f-6fd0-42d2-9516-f1c7a19f72e8","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T04:38:27.847+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:38:51.927+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:47:52.023+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"3e122354-d927-4560-a71d-88f31af98504"},{"end":4,"tag":"Biological Kind","start":0,"value":"They","tag_id":"b3c56c74-2d45-483d-945d-9103cf870c36","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"2eb81d2f-6fd0-42d2-9516-f1c7a19f72e8","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T04:38:27.846+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:47:44.375+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:39:00.688+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"ad690523-eb99-4f72-aaed-c1736426ec73"},{"end":19,"tag":"Perceptual","start":14,"value":"sweet","tag_id":"3302eb94-c347-42d4-a94e-fa696faadced","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"2eb81d2f-6fd0-42d2-9516-f1c7a19f72e8","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:47:44.377+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T04:38:27.848+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:38:55.49+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"6f16ecc8-467c-4b9e-99a7-35cd51f682f8"}],"classifications":[]},{"content":"And thanks for saying all that, buddy.","seen_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","annotator_id":5}],"comments":[],"metadata":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"Ease":53.41,"Genre":null,"Grade":7.2,"Notes":null,"Title":"Angry Birds: Summer Madness","Author":null,"Source":"Netflix","Age Max":12,"Age Min":7,"Content":"Camp Splinterwood Our summer home For catapulting, slingshotting, Getting thrown Campers rocket through the trees Cannonballing where they please Zipping in the air Crashing everywhere Archery, Dodgebird Borb tennis -- it's absurd! Here they come Red, Stella, Bomb and Chuck Flying fast Look out, duck ! All your life you'll be glad You had this Angry Birds Summer Madness Good morning, Camp Splinterwood! As you head out to your next activity, be sure to look out for-- Care packages! Huh? Huh?! Ooh! Oh! Whew! Have a Splinterwood-iful day! Look, I know our counselors expect us to… shoot some hoops, but sports isn't really my thing-- Ow! So, why don't we… take it easy and-- Will you stop that? Oh… Neiderflyer. Uh, this basketbird court is taken. We were here first! You want to fight for it? Oh, please say yes. I can't even remember the last time I was in a fight. Um, just now, in Arts and Crafts? You got a problem, vase? I'll tell you what. I'll let one of you shoot for it. Make it, take it. Look, Neiderflyer, you're being as charming as always. By which I mean, not charming at all. But, how dumb do you think we are? Should I shoot from over here? Or here? How about here? How about over here? Chuck! I'm open! Ugh! Oh! Ah! Oh yeah. In your beak-- Yoink! No. Not you. Him. Uh… Okay, it's all on you. This is it. One shot for the win. No pressure. Okay, maybe some pressure. Maybe a lot of pressure. But it's okay. Just don't think about the pressure! Not helping, Chuck. Bomb, you got this. Ahh! And that is game. Hey, look! It's a care package somebird's parents flung from home. Looks like a nice one, too. We'll take that. I don't see your name on it, Neiderflyer. I don't see yours either, Maroon. Come on, you know my name is Red. So sorry, did I say maroon? I meant moron. That's it! Yes, that is it! Hi, Matilda. Oh my. Your chakras… they are just-- Ooh, they are bursting with energy, aren't they? Uh-huh. Anyhoo, like I was saying, that is it! My campers' care package. I thank you and the universe for finding it. No problem. I mean, what kind of jerk would take candy from a hatchling? Cabin raid! Guess that answers my question. How could Neiderflyer do that? It makes me angry! And when I get mad, I get-- Lunch! I guess I get lunch. But after lunch, I get even. I'm gonna raid Neiderflyer's bunk and get the hatchlings' care package back! Now, we just need a plan. Okay, okay, plan. Ooh! I got it. Bomb blows up Neiderflyer's cabin while the rest of us use paddles to tunnel in from below. Wait, no, that's a terrible idea. Okay, forget that. So we push Neiderflyer's bunk to the lake, float it onto the water, and then swing over from the bungee rope course and board it like pirates. Arrh! Ha ha ha. Actually, that's a dumb idea, too. How about we borrow nurses' uniforms from the infirmary and then quarantine Neiderflyer's bunk for bird flu… No, that's a plan-- Hey wait! This one's not so crazy. This could actually work. Give it to me straight. It's bad, right? Look, I'm not going to lie to you. It's bad. And here you go. I can't believe that worked and without any consequences whatsoever. Up top! Cabin raid. Whoa! You put them in Terence's cabin? Yup. Why are you doing this? This seems like way too much effort for you. Maybe because I never get care packages. Or maybe I'm just bored. Slow day at the office. Neider-jerk. He's here. Droppings! Okay, look, yes, Terence is on the large side, but how tough can he really-- Is he bench pressing his cabin? We gotta get the hatchlings out! Yeah, you guys seem to have this under control, so I'm just gonna-- This is my fault. If I hadn't gotten mad, the hatchlings wouldn't be in this mess. I gotta learn to control myself. What? No, Red. You getting angry and making sure bullies and jerks don't ruin our summer, that's what makes this the best camp ever! Well, that and the marshmallows. Ugh! You're crushing my hollow bird bones. Thanks. And thanks for saying all that, buddy. Yeah, I never knew you could talk that much. I like it. Me too. And you're right. We gotta fix this. By pulling one last raid on Terence's cabin. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! No, no, no, no! I meant we should go tell our counselor… Mighty Eagle. Sorry, boys, I got bigger problems. This bod? It's not gonna tan itself. That's literally how tanning works. Yeah, that's-- that's great, guys. Hey, ladies, got any extra sunblock? I got a lot of real estate to cover here. Ugh! I guess it does have to be us. Okay, we're gonna need an amazing plan because if Terence even suspects we messed with his bunk, he'll stomp our beaks straight out of our butts! You don't need to come up with a plan. You already did! I did? I thought my plans were too crazy to work. They totally were, on their own. But put them together and you got a plan that's so cuckoo insane, it just might work! Come on, you gotta explode. The whole plan starts with you blowing up, so don't blow it, I mean, do blow it! Not helping. Maybe this will. Chuck said the hatchlings were in trouble, and the only thing that will help is this. Fire in the face hole! Everybody out! Two, three, four. Yup, we're all here. Including him! We're too far away for him to see who we are! Terence doesn't know which campers to pound! What are you doing? Making sure Terence knows who to pound! That's a terrible idea. If I can just-- Everybody off! Bomb's away! You got it. No! I meant Bomb's away from where he was gonna catch me! I'm fine. Oh, thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Uh, could you hold these for a second? Stella, jump. You don't have to crash and burn with me. You're dang right I don't. Ever since kindergarten you've been getting me in trouble. And if you think I'd miss a minute of it, you're insane! Ha ha! Whoo-hoo! Oh, I can't wait to dig into this thing. What? How did your cabin get here? I-- I didn't-- No, please don't pound me.

The Covert League of Animal Detective Experts. Sam Snow. Kit Casey. The Creature Cases! The Forest Food Bandit. Bo-Bok! With these berries, I finally have enough food to last all winter! Better put them in the pantry. This was full of food earlier! Wait-- What--? Where did my berries go? Someone stole all my food! Kit! Look at this one! I love reading these old case files. There's so much history! More like mystery. Look at all these cases, solved by legendary CLADE agents. Holy mole rat! Sam, look! Is that Director Scratch? She would have been Agent Scratch back then. \"Case closed.\" \"Case closed.\" Wow! Looks like she solved more cases than any other CLADE agent ever. Huh? But there's one case she never closed. No check mark, see? Huh. The Roxy Raider Incident. I wonder what the-- The CLADE crest! Director Scratch must have a new case for us! Director, we were just going through your old case files and-- Bo-Bok! Agents, we have a situation in the North American Forest. This rabbit's winter food supply has been stolen. We don't know who the thief is, but… Strange. This case almost reminds me of… Director Scratch? Bo-Bok! Agents, your mission is to figure out who the thief is and return the stolen food. You can count on us, Director. Now arriving at destination biome… …North American Forest. I don't know about you, Sam, but after reading about all those old cases, I'm extra excited to solve this new one. Same here. The more cases we solve, the closer we get to being as legendary as Director Scratch. My winter food. It's all gone! Mine too! And mine! What will we do? What will my babies eat? Seems like the rabbit isn't the only one who had his food stolen. This case just got a lot more complicated. Excuse me, folks. I'm Agent Kit Casey. And I'm Agent Sam Snow from CLADE. Now, who here is missing food? Don't worry. We're here to help. Did you bring us more food? Uh, no. Oh. What will we eat? I need food for the winter! Hold on! Don't panic! We're going to catch the thief and get your food back. But we'll need to interview you all one at a time. Whose food went missing first? Mine. Then we'll start with you. A-A-And when I opened the pantry, my food was gone. My apples. My berries. My carrots. All of it! So the thief wanted fruits and vegetables. Must be an herbivore. A what? Herbivore means a plant-eater. Anything else you can tell us? Well, the weirdest thing was that I keep my pantry locked. I keep some real high-quality carrots in there. You'd have to be good with your hands to pick a lock like that. An herbivore who's good with their hands. Hang on. Look at this. A paw print. Another clue. Can't tell who it's from. We still need more info. Come on! So one moment I had a bowl full of worms and grubs, and the next moment they were gone! Just like the rabbit's fruits and vegetables. Except that an herbivore wouldn't eat worms and grubs. The thief must be an omnivore, something that eats everything. I really thought my food was safe. I mean, my house is all the way up in this tree. So either the thief can fly or they're a good climber. Sam, look! The same paw print as before! How quickly do you think you can catch this thief? My kids are getting hungry. Mom, when's dinner? Don't worry. We're on the case. It's the darnedest thing. I opened the fridge, and all my food had vanished. And let me guess. You keep your food somewhere that's hard to steal from. I sure do. I keep a light in the living room for guests. But the rest of the house is pitch black. Go on into the kitchen and see for yourselves. Pitch black, all right. So the thief can see in the dark too. What kind of food did they take? Nuts and seeds. Wow, this thief really does eat everything. Huh. And there's that same paw print! Thanks for your time. We'll get your food back before you know it. So here's what we've got. This thief can see in the dark, can either fly or climb, is good with their hands… And they eat lots of different foods. Sam, I can think of only one animal that matches all those clues. A raccoon! Director Scratch! What are you doing here? Sorry to surprise you, agents. But I couldn't stop thinking about this case. It reminds me of another case I worked on a long time ago, right here in this very forest. The Roxy Raider Incident. I was a CLADE agent in my prime. There was no case I couldn't crack, no suspect I couldn't catch. I was the best there was. So when I was sent to the forest to investigate a theft, I thought I had it in the bag. The details of the case were exactly the same as yours. Stolen food right before winter. Paw prints left behind. The thief was a raccoon, but not just any raccoon. It was Roxy Raider, the trickiest bandit around. She could climb any tree, see in the dark, pick any lock with her nimble paws. In short, a master thief. I almost caught her, but she escaped down the river. Roxy Raider! I never did catch her. It was the only case I couldn't close. Do you think Roxy is the thief? Did you find a paw print at every place where food had been stolen? We did! Then it's definitely Roxy! She leaves paw prints behind as her special mark. What does Roxy Raider look like, Director? What in the woolly world?! She looks like this! After her! Huh? Come on! Ha! Whoa! Ouch! She was tricky then, and she's even trickier now. Hmm. Then we'll have to get tricky too. Kit, is there anything you know about raccoons that could help us get one step ahead of her? Well, they're strong swimmers. They sometimes wash their food. Wash their food? Raccoons like to get their food wet because it makes their paws extra sensitive. That way, they can really feel what they're eating. Whiskers, that's it! Director, you said you lost her near the river. Maybe that's where she's going this time. Of course! To wash all her stolen food! I think you're onto something. Let's move! I think I lost those CLADE clods! Ha! Now, let's see what we got here. Mmm! Perfectly ripe! Stop right there, Roxy Raider! You again! Bo-Bok! Going somewhere, Roxy? Well, if it isn't Peggy Scratch. You finally found me. Took you long enough. But I caught you nonetheless. Agents, let's get this food back to the other animals. Uh, Director Scratch, it's all gone. Aw! My food! Your food? That food belonged to those other animals. And you're going to help us collect more. Help you? Ha! Why should I do that? Because if you don't, these poor, innocent baby birds will go hungry this winter. Won't you help us, please? Okay, okay, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt anybody. Well, now's your chance to make things right. What do you say? I say… let's get to work! Ugh! Come get it. Here. Mmm. I can't thank you enough. More grubs, please. Ugh! Thank you, thank you! You don't know how much this means to us! Now every animal has enough food for winter. These seeds are for you. Thanks! Stay warm! Ah, it felt good helping those folks. Snow! From now on, no more stealing food for me. Then I declare this Creature Case… Closed! After all these years, this case is finally, finally closed. Goodbye, Roxy. See you, Scratch. Nice work today, agents. Keep it up and you might just beat my case record one day. You really think so? I do. In the meantime, I'm going to make a note of your excellent work in your file. Hang on. Where's my pen? [dramatic music plays, then humorous notes] Roxy Raider! Fact File! Yeah! Mice Squad Fact File. - Bill - Jill -Status? - Chill System settings? Set to thrill! Update. Raccoons. Fact File! Raccoons are adventurous. They're great at climbing and exploring in the dark. And they'll eat just about any food. Fact File! Raccoons love using their hands. Their quick fingers can even open locks. Fact File! Raccoons sometimes wash their food. By feeling it when it's wet, they learn more about what they're eating. Error. Upload incomplete. How to fix it? Move your feet. Fact File! Fact File! Fact File! Yeah! The Case of the Absent Giraffe. Bo-Bok! Now, remember, class. The yummiest leaves are on the highest branches. So, reach, reach, reach! Ah! If your neck doesn't reach, Gordy, try using your tongue like this! I will! Just wait! I'm gonna get the best leaves ever. Uh, hmm. Uh… Hey. Over there! A storm. Better take shelter. Gwendolyn, Gilly, Grayson, Greg. Where's Gordy? Gordy? Gordy! Gordy's hat! Concentrate. Concentrate. Whoa! Kit. What? Whoa! Do you mind? The humming? Oh! I didn't even know I was doing it. Sam! What? Sorry to get you all wet, Sam. But the CLADE crest? Director Scratch has a new Creature Case for us! You're humming again. Whoops! Bo-Bok! Agents. We've got an urgent case in the African Grasslands. The Mice Squad just sent us these photos. A young giraffe named Gordy has gone missing from his class. His class? Giraffes go to school? Sort of. Sometimes, giraffe parents will leave their kids with other grown-ups for the day. Kind of like dropping them off at school. There's no time to waste, agents. It's up to you to figure out where Gordy went. We're on it, Director. Now arriving at destination biome… …African Grasslands. Thanks, R.O.N. Whew! Good thing we got here after the storm. Why? So you don't have to get your fur wet again? No, uh… So it will be easier to interview these giraffes. Afternoon, folks. We're here from CLADE to find Gordy. Thank goodness you're here! Thank you for coming! We've been worried sick. Huh? Help us find him! One moment, please. Kit, I can barely hear them. I was gonna tell you. Giraffes talk in really low voices, which can be a little hard for other animals to hear. But don't worry. I called for backup. Hey, guys. Heard you need some audio gear. These will help you hear the giraffes. Whoa. So tall. Thanks, Mice Squad. What? It was catchy! You don't know what… We were teaching him to reach leaves when the storm came. That's when we saw that he was gone. The savanna's too dangerous for Gordy out on his own. There are predators out there. Don't worry. We'll find him. Better look for clues. Hmm. Ugh! Hmm. Check it out, Kit. Footprints! Hmm. Hard to make out after all this rain. But those are young giraffe prints, all right. Good work, Clu-Bots. Gordy must've gone this way. Come on! Looks like Gordy came to the watering hole. Lucky for us, it's full of potential witnesses. Excuse me, folks. Have any of you seen a young--? Careful, Sam! There are predators around! We can't let them know there's a young giraffe loose. A young giraffe, you said? What I meant was… Reggie! Kit! It's good to see ya. Can I interest my favorite detectives in some nice, cool pond water? Thanks, but not now, Reggie. We're on a case looking for this guy. Oh yeah. I've seen him. Headed off towards the river. Gettin' kinda late for a little feller, ain't it? We better find that river fast. Thanks for the tip, Reg. Anytime, you two. Huh. That's strange. I don't see any rivers on the map. But listen. Do you hear that? Sorry. Sounds like running water. This way! Well, ain't that something. A river that wasn't on the map. And look. More giraffe prints. Gordy must've gone into the river. I don't think so, Sam. Giraffes aren't known to be swimmers. And this river is too deep for Gordy to wade through. There's something fishy going on. Here, fishy. Better talk to that turtle. Maybe he saw something. Excuse me, sir. Huh? We're from CLADE. Have you seen this giraffe? Hmm. Was he a young feller out wandering all by himself? Yes! Nope, I haven't seen him. Then again, the river and I just got here. The river just got here? Yep. This river only fills up with water after big rainstorms like the one today. Kit, it all makes sense! It does? Gordy must've crossed the river before there was a river. He just walked across the grass. Good thinking, Sam. Let's get across and stay on Gordy's tail. Watch your step now. This river can be a little unpredictable. Here, fishy, fishy, fishy. Kit! Oops. Was I humming again? Ha! Oh! That's funny. Is there another river around here? Not a river. It's a flash flood! What in the woolly world?! Hurry! Oh no! The log! Whoa! Whoa! Sam! Looks like you got a little wet. You okay, Sam? I'm fine. Let's go. Kit, look! Uh, what are we looking at? Isn't it obvious, Kit? The leaves on the trees! The first eight feet have been eaten. That's just about the height of a young giraffe with his long tongue sticking out. Gordy! He must be close! Seriously, Kit. How can you be humming at a time like this? But, Sam, I'm not humming. Then who's making that sound? It's a low sound. Really low. Almost as low as… …a giraffe! Follow that hum! Gordy! Did someone say my name? We sure did. Was that you humming out here? Yeah. We giraffes hum to each other. I wanted to show someone how I learned to reach really tall leaves now. Want to see? That's great, Gordy. We're here to take you back to your class so you can show all of them too. School's almost over! And my mom will be coming to pick me up soon. She's gonna be so worried. Do you think we could get to school before my mom does? Uh-huh. Luckily, with such long legs, you giraffes are pretty speedy. Ready to run? Uh-huh. Yeah! Whoa! Hey! We're almost there! Hm. I don't see Gordy anywhere. Well, uh, there's something you should know. It's about-- Gordy! Mom! Oh! Guess what? Today, I reached the best leaves all by myself. That's great, Gordy! Another Creature Case… Closed! Sam! Watch! Over here! Hey! Look at me! I can… I'm eating, and I'm reaching! Way to go, Gordy! Well, look who's humming now. I didn't even know I was doing it. Fact File! Yeah! Mice Squad Fact File. - Bill - Jill Status? Chill System settings? Set to thrill! Update. Giraffes. Fact File! Young giraffes don't really go to school. But sometimes, their parents will leave them with other adult giraffes who watch them. Fact File! You won't often see a giraffe swim. Their long legs and bodies make it hard. Fact File! Giraffes make some sounds that are hard for other animals to hear. If you listen, you might hear one humming. Error. Upload incomplete. How to fix it? Move your feet. Fact File! Fact File! Fact File!

I don't know! I may have \"borrowed\" your sticks, but I'd never steal Sunny. I promise. Are you sure? No tricky stuff? Listen, I don't pull those kinds of tricks, but I know some trickster spirits who do. There are more trickster spirits? Oh, yeah. Moon, little help? Fine. A moon shadow show? Cool! Wow! Once upon a cloud, there were four prank-loving pals. First is Raven spirit from the Pacific Northwest. She's the brains behind most of their pranks. This wouldn't be the first time she's tried to get her talons on Sunny. Second is Rabbit spirit from the Southeast. He's a loose cannon who loves two things, carrots and pranks. And he's all out of carrots. And third is Raccoon spirit from the Northeast. She's the muscle of the team. She's so strong, I once saw her move Woodpecker's tree to the South Pole while he was sleeping. He woke up frozen! Oh, no! I'm turtle trembling. They call themselves the Trickster Trio. They'll prank any spirit, human, or even Sunny himself! But why would they steal him? Probably because he keeps beating them at stick game. They hate to lose, and Sunny just loves to brag. Hmm, didn't you say there were four prank-loving pals, Coyote? Well, yeah. I kinda, sorta, maybe, definitely used to work with them. How do we know you're not still pranking with them now? Hold your horse spirits. When we were partners, we just did petty jokes. But once they started with the high pranks and goofs-demeanors, it was too much. Even for me! I had to get out. I'll prove it to you. I know where to find them. But be on your toes. Their hideouts might be full of pranks. Come on. Hey, you pranked me. Oops, sorry. I told you there would be pranks. Snakes! Coyote! I didn't know they'd have prank snakes. Honest. Hmm. Blech. This feels like a wild-coyote chase. Whoa! We've looked everywhere for the Trickster Trio, and we've only gotten pranked. Okay, there were a lot of pranks, but I promise I didn't know about them. Even if they were kind of funny. Let's keep looking. Maybe we should look for Sunny on our own. Yeah, I think Coyote is just gonna lead us to more pranks. Summer, can you try to spot Sunny with your hawk-eye vision? On it! I'll be back in a squawk. That light looks just like Sunny. Come on! At least you're still with me, right, flower? Prank flower. Oh! You guys see this? Oh, never mind. Huh? It's Sunny. We found him. Shh! Look. Huh? Coyote was right about one thing, the Trickster Trio is real. Huddle up, Rangers. It's game time, and I've got a plan. I'll paint a big red X on the ground and put a fresh bugsagna on it. Spirits love bugsagna. Then, Eddy, you build a cage out of sticks. And, Kodi, you drop the cage to trap them. All right. With the Trio trapped, we can save Sunny. Hey, look! There's a plate of bugsagna we can use. Wait, where did that come from? And has this red X always been here? Oh no! You thought you could trap us with a bugsagna gag? We wrote the book on bugsagna gags. Hey, they think we're pranking amateurs. We was one hop ahead of you this whole time. Who are you anyway? We're the Spirit Rangers. Now, give Sunny back. No deal. Sunny stays with us. Yes. And remember, you can never out-trick the Trickster Trio! They're just too tricky. I don't think we'll get Sunny back. Unless we think like a trickster. I know just who to ask. Come on! Wow. Ah! Prank snake. Oh no! Oh, Spirit Rangers, you're back. Coyote, you were right. It was the Trickster Trio all along. They took Sunny and, uh-- Wait. What are you doing with that prank snake? Uh… Nothing. It's not what it looks like. I'm not planning a prank right now. Look, I might be a trickster spirit, but I'm also your friend. Trust me. I may enjoy a little joke From time to time All right, so I'm a prankster In his pranking prime But when it comes to friendship I'm steady as an oak I'm here for you And that's no joke I've pulled some wild shenanigans To great acclaim The trickiest of tricksters In the trickster hall of fame But friendship is a promise That I will not revoke I'm here for you And that's no joke There comes a time When even I get serious A time when All the joking finally ends And when you need my help I'm always serious 'Cause we're seriously friends I swear that you can trust me And I'm not blowing smoke I'm here for you And that's no joke We're sorry we didn't believe you, Coyote. I know I can be tricky, but not when our friends need help. Prank snake! Wait a sec. Pranks got us into this mess, maybe pranks can get us out of it too. Now you're thinking like a trickster. And I know just how to out-prank them. Hey, squirt. Move along! We're not giving Sunny back, capisce? Actually, we don't need you to give us Sunny back. We already have him. That's a good one. Nice try. Nothing gets past my bird brain. See for yourself. What? How? Impossible! So pretty. Which one of you let Sunny go? Hey, I couldn't have done it. I was too busy thinking about carrots. Baby carrots, and purple carrots, and-- Stop! No! Don't let Sunny get away! It keeps slipping out of my talons! Out of my way! Quick! While they aren't looking! Oh my stars. Thank you, Spirit Rangers. Hey, tricksters. Did you miss me? Coyote? What are you doing here? Oh, just doing what I do best. Pranks. That's not Sunny! No! You foiled us this time, but this isn't the last you've seen of the Trickster Trio! Thanks, Coyote. We couldn't have saved Sunny without you. That's what friends are for. And for playing pranks and games with. Speaking of games, we can finally play stick game! Well, you're gonna need these winner sticks. Eddy's first. Guess. Which hand do you think has the striped stick, hon? Come on, Eddy. Kids win! I did it! Hmm. I thought the stick was in my other hand. Weird. Maybe it was the tricksters again. You might be right. Mama Bear reporting. Baby Bear, do you and Hover Hawk see the target? On it, Mama Bear. But we can't get close enough. Air Dad 1, do you have eyes on her? Aw! It's a kitty! I'll call you P-a-sh Pay-sh. That's the Cowlitz word for \"kitten.\" I've got you, P-a-sh Pay-sh. Here, kitty. Oh, goodness! Got you, little kitty. Whoo-hoo! Alright! Good catch, Eddy. Is P-a-sh Pay-sh okay? I think so. Hmm. I'm not seeing a collar. She might be a stray. A stray? There's no way a kitten this cute doesn't have a home. If P-a-sh Pay-sh doesn't have a home, what if we adopt her? Aw, Eddy. Adopting a cat is a big responsibility. Dad's right. Kittens need a lot of time and attention to be safe and happy. I can do it. Did you see how awesome I was when I rescued her? That was great, Eddy, but we still think you should wait before adopting. Aw. My friends at the cat rescue will find her a home. Now let's get you cleaned up. You're one adventurous kitty. But we can keep her here. I want a cat more than anything. Excuse me. Do you mind lowering your voices? I don't want to wake my kittens. I spent the past hour purring them to sleep. Did you say \"kittens\"? Shh! They're asleep. Did you say \"kittens\"? Sure did. I'm Tuk'e'm, the Chumash mountain lion spirit. These are my spirit kittens, Meow Meow, Mittens, and Lalanxa. I love kittens. So cute. They're just like P-a-sh Pay-sh! I wish we could play with them. Well, you can! I've heard Spirit Rangers take care of every crook, cranny, and critter. Want to kitten-sit for me? Uh… I don't think we're ready to-- We'll do it. I know Mom and Dad said we're not ready. But I think we're responsible enough. Well, they are super cute. Thanks. Yeah. Maybe it won't be that hard. Creator knows I could use a nap. Have fun with the Spirit Rangers, my babies. Meow, meow. Haku! Play, Spirit Rangers. This cannot be good. We got this. Let's go to Spirit Park, where we could have some real fun. Let's go, Spirit Rangers Calling on Spirit Rangers Let's go, Spirit Rangers Calling Kodi, Summer, Eddy Kodi cub! Summer hawk! Spirit Rangers Spirit Rangers And Eddy turtle! Let's go, Spirit Rangers Calling on Spirit Rangers They're Spirit Ranger ready Kittens, are you ready to play? Play! Are you kitten me? Ah, so, you're watching the spirit kittens. They can be a pawful. Tell me about it. They won't stop chasing my sunbeams. No. No. No! Spirit Park might not be able to handle cute kittens, but I can. You know who's simply purr-fect And paw-sitively great? All these little kitties I could play with every day I am smitten by these kittens I am smitten by these kittens No, I ain't kitten' I am smitten There's a paw-sibility You're all my best fur-ends There will be no cat-tastrophes On Eddy you can depend I am smitten by these kittens I am smitten by these kittens No, I ain't kitten' I am smitten See? This is easy. We've got this covered like fur on a cat. Are you sure? It looks like Mittens is about to jump into a dangerous volcano. No! Mittens! Stop! Gotcha. Little stink bug. Phew. Good save. That was close. Hey, uh, real quick. Did anyone else feel a kitten try to jump inside their head or was that just me? Nope. Eh, not any more than usual. Sorry, Lawetlat'la. We'll play somewhere a little less lava-y. Yeah. We need to tire them out before they pounce again. Too late. Whee! Looks like it's time for a turtle tumble! Whee! Seriously?! Come on! Yeah! Dad was right. Taking care of animals is harder than it looks. No, it isn't. We got this. And just look at them. All of this playing has finally tuckered them out. I want bugsagna. You and me both, little guy. After all of this running and playing, I need to hibernate. I'll just rest my hawk eyes for a second. See? Kitten-sitting is… …easy. Hey, uh, Spirit Rangers, you might want to wake up. What? Why? Five more minutes. Let's just say the kittens woke up, ran off, and are causing chaos all over the park! Which is usually my job. Oh no. We need to find them quick. Huh? This is not a scratching post! Summer hawk to the rescue! Sorry, Condor. We'll fix your home later. Don't you dare! That's my best friend's forever mug. Cup! There. Your cup is safe and sound. And Lalanxa is coming with me. Come here, kitty. Huh! Oh, no, you don't. It felt like a kitten tried to jump into my head again. Weird. Maybe I need to clear out my sinuses. Whee! For being so cute, these kittens sure are troublemakers. No wonder Tuk'e'm needed a cat nap. I could use another hibernation. But I love them so much. Play! We've just gotta keep them safe and in one place. I have the perfect idea of how to keep them together. Welcome to your new kitten playpen. Wow! Purr-fect idea, Eddy! They have toys, a cat tower, food and water. And there's nothing they could destroy. This might actually work. See? I can take care of kittens. Now, do you kitties promise to stay put and not get into any trouble? Yep, definitely gone. Again? Where could they be? I th-- thought I had it under control. Oh no! They're at the edge of the waterfall. Hurry! Oh no! Uh-oh. We can't let them fall. This is a cat-tastrophe. We need to save them. Wait! Remember when we tried to grab P-a-sh Pay-sh at the Ranger tower and she got scared and fell? We need a distraction. Hmm. What if we try distracting the kittens with things they like? That's it. Once we distract them, I can sneak up and catch them with my turtle bubbles. Come on. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Over here! Pretty kitty! Huh? Look at the feathers. Tickle, tickle! Wanna play? I know you want the toy. Yes, you do. Ah! Oh, no! Fun! Kittens! No! Eddy! Hurry! There. Now you're safe and sound. Phew. Ah, well, it's good to know the spirit kittens are okay. Watch the tail! So, what did I hiss? I mean, miss. Sorry, us cats hiss a lot. Mama! Wow, my kittens are safe, and they seem really happy. You can kitten-sit my babies anytime you'd like. Tuk'e'm, we had fun kitten-sitting for you today, but it was a lot harder than we thought it'd be. And I'm not sure if my hawk heart can take another kitten rescue. Yeah. If today has taught me anything, it's that I'll have a cat of my own someday, but I'm not ready now. Even if I love them so, so, so, so, so much. Well, you can visit my spirit kittens any time. Right, babies? Yes! Yay! Aw. Aw, cute. But next time, leave the chaos to me. There. Now you're ready for your new family. Hi, P-a-sh Pay-sh. We made you something special to remember us by. Ta-da! Now you're an honorary Junior Ranger. Okay, kids. Our friend at the cat rescue is here, and she's ready to take P-a-sh Pay-sh to her new home. Honey, seeing P-a-sh Pay-sh leave might be too much for the kids. No, it's okay. I know I'm not ready to adopt a cat yet. I'm sad but also happy P-a-sh Pay-sh is going somewhere that can take care of her. That's really wise, little guy. I know that this sort of thing can be hard, but I just want you to know that we found your kitten a nice home with a good family that has everything a kitten could need. Purrfect. Aw. Yay! Hi, baby. Want to say goodbye to your friends before you go? It tickles. Aw, so cute. Bye! Have fun in your new home! I'm so glad I got to meet you, P-a-sh Pay-sh.

We got eggies, taters, and to finish it off, what no breakfast can be complete without: perfect toast! Yeah! What's full of wheat germ And loaded with yeast? Fün der bread It's for humans and beasts!

Toast it! Toast it! To have yourself a treat! Because toasting Old time Fün der bread Makes it edible and sweet! Our perfect sleepover is ruined! All I wanted was for us to have the perfect sleepover. And you ruined perfect breakfast. Ooh, ow, ow! I'm sorry, but why do we have to put up with toasters? Even though they have seven different heat levels, they'll still ignore all of them and burn the bread anyway. Yeah, what's up, toasters? Man hasn't changed the toaster in a hundred years. How is it that we have every smart appliance from watches, to refrigerators, but no one's created a smart toaster? Why has no one created a smart toaster? Because it's our destiny! I may not know exactly how toasters or electricity works, but I know we must have the technology to allow the toaster to sense when the bread is at its perfect toast level. Like artificial intelligence. Yes, like artificial intelligence. Together, we'll create a new, revolutionary toaster. Yes! One that can know exactly when the toast is done. Together, we'll change the world! Tell 'em like you tell 'em. Now all we need is an AI chip that can make this toaster as smart as that fridge. Great work, Max. Now to change the world. Oh, no, oh, no, what do we do, what do we do?! Hm. So that's how babies are made. Oh. He's... so beautiful. He has your eyes. I'm gonna call you Toasty. Aw, he looks like a Toasty. And you're gonna make the best toast the world has ever seen. Toasty, Toasty, Toasty! Oh, goodbye, perfect Christmas! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He's just a baby. Could you make perfect toast when you were a baby? Honey, look, we created life. Interesting. Now let's see how it feels about electrocution. No, you couldn't. Well, not to worry. If we raise Toasty right, I'm sure he'll grow up to be the perfect, little smart toaster. Isn't that right? Ready when you are, co-dad. What are you doing? Being a dad! Subject appears to be alive and of toaster origin. Indeed! Now, come on, Papa-two, it's time for Toasty's first lesson. My Toasty, toast it To make yourself a treat Because toasting Old time Fün der bread Makes it edible and sweet! Ah. Reacts positively to bad singing. Well, he also likes your cooking. How fresh! Okay, Toasty, let's try this again. Mwah. Aw. Great job, Toasty! Failure. Careful, he'll hear you! So? So, hearing he failed can emotionally ruin him and we'll never get great toast. But why would you try and make better toast, if you're already telling him he's doing the perfect toasty making? You obviously have no idea how to parent. Before a child can succeed, you need to make them believe they can. No, no, no, no, that's all wrong. First, you stare at them when they're asleep and awake. You just always stare at them. Then you put them through rigorous and often painful tests. And most importantly, you only call them by their experiment number to prevent any emotional attachment. Okay, test subject 00001. Let's try that again. Toasty isn't some experiment that accidentally became sentient. What? This is a living, breathing toaster that we just so happened to give life to. And I'm gonna make sure his life is a happy and healthy one. So if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go give Toasty his bath. Toasty hated his bath. Oh, what now, he can't catch it because you're the one with the parent issue. He didn't catch it, the kid doesn't have hands, terrible! Ha? James, this is your fault. The toaster right? He's a little baby boy! Scuba diver's on you! Man, that montage really messed up our kid. What are you talking about? He's just playing. Either that or Toasty's starting to be negatively affected by our disagreements. See? Science doesn't lie. Except for the moon landing. Well, it's your fault we've been arguing. According to my calculations, it's your fault. See, look, it's in my calculations. What? I'm the positive parent here. All you do is put him in positions to fail. Well, maybe he's failing because he takes after you! How dare you! I've never failed at anything in my life. Other than choosing you as a friend. Well, maybe we shouldn't be friends. Well, maybe we shouldn't. Relax. Toasty's just expressing himself. Oh, my car! He's just living his truth. My house! It's okay, Toasty, you be you. My legs! That toaster took my legs! I'm all out of platitudes. Toasty, stop! Wait, you'll stifle his creativity. What if destroying things could be the key to perfect toast? Huh? No more playing, Toasty! Time to come... home? Ice cream man? A new phone! Thank you so much, you kind souls-- Ice cream man! Mail, mail, mail, mail, mail! Ha! Run, Toasty! Hiya! Huh? Toasty, this behavior is completely unacceptable. Come with me and we'll do more tests on you. Don't listen to him, Toasty. You just need to channel your energy. Come with me and you'll grow to make perfect toast. Whoa! Ya! Whoa! Yes! You chose me! No! Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Are you hurt, Max? Oh, uh... possibly internally. What? What is this? What is this? Something your father clearly never gave you. A hug. I'm so cold. Max, you're cold-blooded. Oh, yeah! I'm sorry. This is all my fault. No, it's our fault. We let our parenting get in the way of what's really important. Perfect breakfast. And us. It's not perfect breakfast without each other. Ew, why are you so sweaty? It's not sweat. I got hungry! How many slices do you think he has left? Hmm. Three. But two of those are end pieces and everyone knows those aren't any good. Huh? Give it up, Toasty, we have you outnumbered. Huh? Where's he going? The Fün der bread factory? Oh, man, he's gonna' love it there. All the bread he could possibly want. With that much ammo, he could burn this whole town to the ground! Max, are you gonna be okay? Go get our boy. Aw. Hungy. Toast! Huh? Toasty, please! It's our fault you're this way, but you don't have to be. What's full of wheat germ And loaded with yeast? Fün der bread It's for humans and beasts Makes a good sandwich But is better as toast Because Toasty makes our bread Tastier than most So Toasty, my Toasty Put that slice in the slot Toasty, my Toasty Huh? You're the best toaster We've got It's perfect. No! Well, I guess we know why no one's created a smart toaster.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-Y7","Word Count":1313,"Year Published":2023,"Season & Episode":"S01E01"},"example_id":"02741829-9771-4915-895f-e754cb0cec57","annotations":[{"end":31,"tag":"Perceptual","start":26,"value":"whole","tag_id":"3302eb94-c347-42d4-a94e-fa696faadced","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"02741829-9771-4915-895f-e754cb0cec57","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T04:59:48+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:54:32.396+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"ffaddaf2-b70f-4633-b919-bfe9e503b5bd"},{"end":36,"tag":"Non-Living Kind","start":32,"value":"time","tag_id":"a4288773-f6c5-4bc8-8dff-2b16b8f4787e","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"02741829-9771-4915-895f-e754cb0cec57","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:54:34.764+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"77536f92-12f2-4486-82dc-6d554065ee89"},{"end":11,"tag":"Social Kind/Role","start":8,"value":"dad","tag_id":"c2d08238-bcff-4c44-af7c-74c991a2afb3","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"02741829-9771-4915-895f-e754cb0cec57","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:53:57.543+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T04:59:47.997+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:42:14.885+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"d43ff6a0-2cef-4696-82bc-e8ed44b75a8b"},{"end":21,"tag":"Artifacts","start":18,"value":"car","tag_id":"93766023-3257-4bed-8223-6f91c904c834","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"02741829-9771-4915-895f-e754cb0cec57","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:42:16.143+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:54:01.143+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T04:59:47.999+00:00","annotator_id":5}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"6a823b89-bbac-471f-891a-d92db7a407b8"}],"classifications":[]},{"content":"Well, she must be careful because being gigantic has its pros and cons.","seen_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","annotator_id":5}],"comments":[],"metadata":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"Ease":53.06,"Genre":null,"Grade":7,"Notes":null,"Title":"Cry Babies: Magic Tears","Author":null,"Source":"Netflix","Age Max":6,"Age Min":0,"Content":"Oh!

Oh, are you sick? You won't be able to go on vacation. Of course I'm going! It's just because it's hot. The oven is working to the maximum. Huh? Oh! It's true. You're healthy as a strawberry. Oh, I still don't have plans for vacation. You can come with me to Fantasy World. Can you hand me the strawberries? Oops! These were delicious! Ah! Have you eaten like tons of strawberries? Sorry. Cutie, please, go get more strawberries from the woods. I better turn off the oven for a while. Wow. Those are huge! Hmm. And delicious. Those are the special fruits the Fantasy eat. My cupcakes are going to be the best in the whole world. That smell can't be real. I need to try it. Wow! Wandy, who's that with you? This is my cousin Lizzy, and she has come to spend some time with us. Well, you are very lucky. I have just baked some cupcakes. Welcome. Here, one for each. These are so yummy! It's because I used special strawberries. Like the ones the Fantasy eat. It makes sense. Special strawberries? I've never seen those before. I want some of those strawberries. And me. And me. Me too! I'll stay. I have some things to do. I'll join you, but just for a while. I have to go on vacation to the Fantasy World. Join us, Lizzy! Are we there yet? Hmm. It smells like strawberries and melon. Wow! And orange too. This place is a dream. Wow, a paradise! Oh! Watch it, Lady. Um, smells all fruity. Wow. There's jam. This is a new world. This is awesome! Eh? Wow! That's a huge banana! A snack! The best banana in the universe. Amazing, it tastes better than it smells. I will never get tired of eating fruits. The best vacation ever. Oh, I was supposed to join Jassy. Wait, what is she doing? She must have forgotten about us. I will never learn how to make pretzels with my hands. Jassy must be having a lot of fun. Five more minutes. Wow! Are you friends or enemies? Aloha! Wee! These are nice and smell like fruit! Huh? Where are you taking us? Huh? Wait! Lady! Help! Help! We need to tell the others and rescue the babies from those little monsters. Why did they bring us here? You ate the whole harvest. Uh-oh! Welcome to Tutti Frutti Bay! Yeah! Oh! Eh? Eh? Discovering Tutti Frutti Bay, Part 2. Oh! You look perfect for a picture. Eh? Help! They took the babies. What happened, Lady? We were eating gigantic fruit that smelled delicious, but all of a sudden, we saw little colorful monsters speaking a strange language and… Gigantic fruits? Colorful monsters? Strange language? I want to rescue the babies. GPS is on. Me too! Count on me. We went by a jam jar and everything smelled delicious. Oh, smells so good. #FruitSmellGood. Wow! Don't move. The little monsters might be anywhere. It was this way. No, no, no, no, no. This way! Huh? Wow! Awesome! Huh? What was that? It's them! Strange babies are making them carry the fruit. Baba! Hmm! What a delicious orange juice. They're having a bad time! They're giving them orders. We have to rescue them. And if we get caught? I know! We'll wear in disguise! I can't smell my perfume with so much fruit scent. Babies, look, I have my costume. I love your look. It smells delicious. Rym found a trace! I control the Tasty Factory. I'll make 100 grapefruit gummy candies. Oh, no. I set it for a million gummy candies. We'll have to eat them. Ow! Hey! Who are you? What's a mirror doing here? I knew it! There are more babies! This is the end! Hmm? Don't worry. They're our friends. We thought that you had been kidnapped. It feels so good to be all together. What a wonderful tears. Magic Tears Jellies! It's alive! Careful. Don't worry, they're a bit naughty, but they're not dangerous. The Jellies are the foundation of our world. Without them, we wouldn't have fruits so big and juicy. Wow! It looks like they wanna show us Tutti Frutti Bay. We squeeze the fruit in our Tasty Factory, and they go straight away. And the juice will have different colors depending on which fruit it is. And now, the Tasty Factory. This is the mixing pool. What a rhythm! Hey, those are some pretty molds! I love them. Hi! I'm Angie. In this zone you may drink smoothies, milkshakes… Do you have banana with melon and orange? Of course. If you can imagine it, then you can mix it. To Tutti Frutti Bay. I knew it! It's delicious! This is definitely the best vacation of my life. I finally found you! Do you already know about Tutti Frutti Bay? Yup! We know the all the corners of the world and thanks to the spyglass we guard and take care of them! So are there other cool corners like this? Of course. And each one has its own special Magic Tear. And can you take us there? It's better that you discover them little by little. Besides that, you first have to show me how to make pretzels with your hands. The Giant Baby. Uh, uh, uh. What the… I can't reach it. Uh… If you were taller, that wouldn't happen. Okay. But I'm very small. And even if I grow, I'll never be as tall as this tree. Ah-hem. If you ate the gigafruit, you'd be gigantic. The gigafruit? It's a magical fruit! It grows on a magical tree, hidden somewhere in Tutti Frutti Bay. And how come I never heard of it before? We read it on the internet. Angie, you have to eat the gigafruit. If you're gigantic, you can pick better. But how do I find it? Now, we have to call Dotty. You'll see, Spot is the best sniffer in the world. He has a super sense of smell and finds everything. Look! It seems like he's found something. Whoa! Look a tiny tree! Uh, um, this is the magic tree? Uh, don't look at me. Okay, Angie, eat the gigafruit. Oh! Eh… Ooh, earthquake! It's gigantic! Wow! Yes, this year we have… Huh? Huh? She's huge! Angie is a giant. Move away! Run! Hi, babies. Careful, you'll step on me. Hello, Pom! Be careful! You're going to squash me. Mamma mia! Angie, you've turned into a Gigababy! Gigababy? I like it! Whoa! Yeah, you see? You don't have problems picking anymore. Being gigantic is the best. Um, it looks like Angie ate the gigafruit. Well, she must be careful because being gigantic has its pros and cons. Angie, leave the boats alone, you'll break them! It's just that your toys are too small for me. What was that? My tummy, I'm hungry. The meal's ready! Well, let's eat, all of us! I'm starving. Yes! Huh? Wow. She ate everything. I'm bigger. So I have to eat more. Babies, we must do something. Imagine if she sneezes! We could end up on the moon! But how do we turn her small again? Ah-hem. That's easy. She has to eat a minifruit. That's it. A minifruit? It's like the gigafruit, but the opposite. And how do we find it? Spot, search! Well, for a minifruit tree, this is ginormous. Here I go! Okay, Angie, eat it! But I like being big. Yeah, but living with a giant is complicated. It's time you go back to being yourself. I said no. I don't want to be small. Careful! Gigababy's coming! I want to be big! Magic Tears Jellies! Help! Oh, no, Angie! Wow, they're Megajellies! Oh, no! It's my fault. I have to do something. Ha! Ah! Watch out, Daisy! Gigababy, Gigababy Behave yourself Gigababy, Gigababy Sit down and relax Angie. Look what you've done. Wow, did I do all this? Being gigantic is fun for you, but dangerous for the rest of us. You're right. Forgive me. But before I turn small, I want to do something. How big you are Angie! Yay, Angie! Fantastic! That's the Angie we love! You're the best! Aloha! Uh, oh. Do we have any minifruits left? Candy! Banana Slip. I hate when the fruit gets bad. It smells like used socks. Ow! Whoa! That hurts! Are you okay? I'm okay, but my bottom is not. Magic Tears Jellies! It was a funny fall, but you could've hurt yourself badly. Well, someone doesn't know what a compost bin is. Hmm, I suspect who that is. Look! There's more. Let's follow the trail. Yes, more banana peels, more close! Ouch! I knew it! You're the banana eater, peel litterer. Eater? Litterer? What? My name is Nana, you know that Pia. I fell down and it's your fault. You have to be careful or you'll cause more accidents. Sorry, when I have a banana, I enjoy it so much that I forget everything else! Nana! You can't be that spaced out! We must keep Tutti Frutti Bay clean! But don't you think it's prettier like this? The Jellies seem to enjoy it. Well, babies, I'm going to have my snack. Is this possible? Tutti Frutti Bay as my witness, I won't allow another peel to cause an accident again! Ouch! Hmm, love it! Ah! Uh! …in ice cream? Yeah! Banana ice cream! Oh… I'll get it, I'll get… Oh! Eh? Oh, banana juice! Delicious! Oh! No! It's delicious. Look, Tina, try it! Hi, babies, I'm tired of all these peels. Is she only eating bananas? No more trouble, I see the future in my ball. Nana will learn a lesson before another fall. And when is the future? Because the present has got me beat. The future is already here with an unprecedented fear. Nana, no! I told you 1,000 times that peels go in the compost bin. Oh! I forgot. Don't you realize that someone could slip? You're exaggerating. I can't see anything! Oh! Hmm, so taste… Ah! Hey! How fast! I think she'll break the skating world record! Maybe we should help her. No, she needs to learn a lesson. Oh… Hi, cloud, what's up? Is that a bird or a plane? It's Nana! Oops. Sorry! Careful, I'll hit you! Eh? Well, I think she's learned the lesson. Very good! I'll solve this in a snap! Wow! Oh! Ah! The ice cream is slippery as well! Save! Sorry, Pia, I won't litter peels anymore. I'll remember this time for sure! It's dangerous! Look, Pia! You'll be surprised! I slipped on peels so much that I became an expert skater. Wow, what a style, Tina! Oh! Hannah, raise those legs! Whoever does it best, will get an award, these little bananas! And when you finish skating, you know where the peels go, to the compost bin! The Summer Song. Jelly levels, on point. Juice acidity, okay. Welcome to the Great Harvesting Party! Wow! What a party. And you'll start by reciting a poem, on behalf of all the Tutti Frutti! Yeah! The peaches grow The grapefruit blooms The apple and raspberry We have to harvest So that a smoothie we can ingest Great, Angie! I've been working the poem the whole week. Magic Tears Jellies! Let's welcome the Valley Babies, who painted this amazing mural for Tutti Frutti Bay. We painted with squished fruits. That's why it's so colorful. Please, applaud the Valley Babies! Hip, hip, hip, Fantasy! And now, this year, the Fantasy are on fire! Let's get the party started! A strawberry gift Mango and peach A rainbow full of fruits A flavorful kiss Oh, oh, oh I can't stop I danced all day long To the harvest song I can't stop dancing My feet are going crazy My little waist can't stop spinning I can't stop dancing My feet are going crazy My little waist can't stop spinning Let's dance, babies! Woo! Wow! Oh! Oh-oh. Due to the weather conditions, we will have to stop the party and reschedule for next week. Well, another night without surprises. I can't stop dancing My feet are going crazy Wow, that's a great way to start the day. See you later, babies. Looks like they had a blast. Cleaning done. Wait, is nobody taking care of the fruits today? We can't stop dancing. The concert was canceled due to the storm. And since then, we haven't been able to get that song out of our heads. And who's going to harvest the fruit? We have to find a solution. Where will the Fantasy be? Tonight is the concert. Pi, we have to find a way to get that song out of their heads. Oh! What if I can think of an even catchier song? Pi, bring my guitar. I think I have an idea. Oh-oh! It is as Pia told us! Nobody has harvested a single fruit this week. It's the curse of the interrupted song! That terrible storm stopped that beautiful song. Now, these poor babies will keep on dancing until dawn. Do you mean that they won't be able to get the song out of their heads? Until they don't listen to the end? I'm afraid that's true. Now, what are we going to do? Tonight, we will sing again. And this time, we will sing till the end. Yes! And you will be able to harvest the fruit again! Hip, hip… Fantasy! And tonight, once again. Let's dance! Let's dance, babies! And my little waist Can finally get to rest That's it! We're done. Could you please stop dancing? This situation can't keep advancing. Eh? I can't think of another song That isn't the song of the Fruity Rock Rock, rock, a Fruity Rock Rock, rock, a Fruity Rock Forget about that crazy song And feel the rhythm of the Fruity Rock Yeah! Well, it seems like you're done dancing that catchy song. Yes, we made it! It's been an amazing night! Bye, Pia! See you! Rock and roll! Now you can't get that song out of your heads. No. We're joking. Oh. I almost faint. Rescue on the Lake. Hmm. It smells so good. The lake's liquid is perfect to make perfumes. Is it going to take long? Not at all. I'll just get some liquid in my jar and that's it. Not this one. Not this one… Oh. We'll never finish. My jar! We'll help you get it back. It's gonna take forever. Studying the sun is exciting! The sun keeps on shining. Write! Whoa! What is that? Can you see it? We have something to do now. Tutti Frutti! Oh no! It's moving away. Luckily, I have a solution. Yes, I thought so. It's in the middle of the lake. Foxie, draw a boat and use your powers. Yes. Aha! Yeah! Now we can go get the jar! Wow! Great idea. Mel, you're not smiling. Don't you think it's a good idea? Well… No, she doesn't think it's a good idea. The jar is too far away and the boat does not look safe. She's right. Yes, true. Do you know how to overcome your fears? Go get the jar. You'll see, nothing bad will happen. But I don't know how to swim. Don't worry, you won't have to swim, just paddle. Bye! Oh, why do I have to be here? Oh, I'm sinking. The jar! I can go back now. Where is the other paddle? Just one? Hello! Help! I'm trapped. Mel's calling us! She's too far away, I can't read her mind. Easy, everyone. She's just saying she found the jar, right? But I don't think it's just that. Let's see. Why is she paddling in circles? Is it because I drew only one paddle? Oh, no! Mel can't return. She'll live in the lake forever. And it's all my fault. Think, Ella, think. I have an idea! Foxie, draw a rope. Huh? Ha! Oops! I know! A giant fishing rod. Are you sure? Yes! Oh! Huh? Wow! Good. No! Don't even think about it. Think, Ella, think. That's it! I have another idea. Let's empty the lake. I'm not feeling okay. My belly… Go on. We're almost done. Just a few thousand million liters of liquid left. We just can't. Let's see. Oh! Idea. No, it won't work. What about… No. No, no, no. No, I can't think of anything. I'm sorry, Mel. I'm so sorry I was so stubborn. Magic Tears Jellies! Huh? What? Oh. That's it! We can create a path. Come on, babies. Wow! Let's go! Use the fruits to reach the shore! What? He's not expecting me to use the fruits to reach the shore, is he? You can do it! Ha! Yes! Thanks for rescuing me! Ella, I think I'm not scared anymore. By the way, Lady, look what I brought you. The perfect fruit to make a perfume. Yuppa! Let's see. Oh, yes! Can I? Me too! I want some. Hey!

Everyone who lives here is very, very small. I'm Ben Elf! (trumpeting and barking) And I'm Princess Holly. (jingling) (barking and laughter) Come on, let's play! Wait for us! (laughter) (lively music) (trumpeting) (narrator): Today's adventure starts... at the meadow. (giggling) Who can jump the highest? Me! Me! Me! I can jump higher! That's cheating! That's not jumping, that's flying! Jumping is all about using your legs, like this. (laughter) I love playing in the meadow! I hope it never changes! The meadow won't change. It's been here forever and always will be. (thumping) What's that noise?! Giants are coming! Quick! Let's hide! It's only Lucy. The little girl we met at the farm. And her dad's with her. It's so pretty here. Yes, Dad. It's a shame we've got to dig it all up. Dig it all up? Why? To make room for the cows. (mooing) Cows? In the meadow? They're ginormous! The cows can graze in this meadow. Oh... We just need to flatten these molehills. That's not a molehill! That's Gaston's house! (growling) (barking) Gaston! They're going to flatten your house! (howling) Don't worry, Gaston. You can come and live with me in the Little Castle. I'll put the cowshed over there. Oh, no! The cowshed will be right on top of my Little Castle. Don't worry, Holly. You and Gaston can come and stay with me in the Great Elf Tree. And I'll put the cow manure over by those trees. Oh! That's where the Elf Tree is. What's manure? (all): Cow poo! Oh. Maybe I won't stay at the Great Elf Tree. Thanks anyway, Ben. I'd better start building the fence. Psst! Lucy! Lucy! (whispering): Oh. Hello, Ben. Hello, Holly. Your dad is putting his cows right where we live. Yes. Isn't it terrible? You have to tell him to stop! Okay. I'll tell him that elves and fairies live here. No, no! Big people must never know we live here! But I'm a big person and I know. You're special. What can we do, then? Let's ask the Wise Old Elf. He'll know what to do. He's old! He's wise! (all): And he's an elf! (trumpeting) What was that? Shush! We've got to be quiet! Okay. Let's go and tell the Wise Old Elf about the cows. Cows in the meadow?! We'll have to tell the farmer that he can't put his cows here! No, no! We must never talk to big people! Hello, Wise Old Elf. Ah! Big people! Nice to see you again. Oh. Hello, Lucy. I thought you said we should never talk to big people. Well, that's apart from Lucy, of course. Lucy is nice. But we must never talk to grown-up big people. You can't trust them. (all): Oh, no. Don't worry, I'll sort it out. What are you going to do? I'll tell the king to sort it out. Cows?! Yes, Your Majesty. The farmer is going to put cows in the meadow. Right where Gaston's house is! Oh. Well, that's not so terrible. And he's going to put a load of cow poo by the Great Elf Tree. Again, not so bad. You'll get used to the smell. And he's going to build a cowshed on top of the Little Castle! What?! Who is this farmer?! I'll sort him out! How big is he?! Is he as tall as me?! He's my dad. Ah! A big person! And her dad is even bigger! Yes, well, Nanny Plum, come up with a plan. I already have a plan, Your Majesty. Oh, well done. I'll turn him into a frog. You'll turn my dad into a frog? Cool! That's your plan? It's like they always say, \"To get your own way, turn them into a frog!\" That doesn't even rhyme! It's a silly plan. No, it's not. Yes, it is. And I absolutely forbid you to-- (croaking) As I was saying, to get your own way, turn them into a frog! (croaking) Oh, well done, Nanny Plum. The plan does work! Carry on. Right you are, Your Majesty! --even think about doing anything so... Oh. Where did Nanny go? He's almost finished the fence! Frog time! What? (croaking) Problem solved. Frogs can't build fences. Um... will my dad be a frog forever? Oh, no. It'll wear off after a while, and he'll be back to his old self again. But won't he just start building the fence again? Oh. I never thought of that. (croaking) Uh-oh. I think the spell is wearing off. Quick! Hide! Huh? Where was I? Oh, yes, I was building a fence. It's been ages! How long does it take to turn someone into a frog? Hmm. Maybe I should go and see how Nanny Plum is doing. Good idea. Off you go, then. There's a good elf. So how is the brilliant plan going? I turned the farmer into a frog. Then he turned back again. And he's still building the fence! No worries, I'll turn him into a frog again. Frog time! No, Nanny! This plan is silly. Alright, smarty-pants, what's your plan, then? Maybe Lucy's mum can stop the farmer. But you said we can't talk to grown-up big people! We can't, but Lucy can. Yes. I could ask my mum to stop Dad. Come on! The important thing is, Lucy, not to mention elves and fairies. Okay, Wise Old Elf! Mummy! Mummy! Hello, Lucy. I thought you were helping Dad today. I was, but-- But what? Oh, Mummy, can't Dad put the cows somewhere else? Lucy, whatever has got you so upset? It's just that my friends the elves and fairies live there. Oh, no! She's telling her everything! Elves and fairies. How lovely. No, Mum, it's true! Right. Leave it to me. There really are elves and fairies! I know there are, darling. Do you? Frog time! Oh! Hello, Nanny Plum. Uh... hello. Mummy! How do you know Nanny Plum's name? Because I remember her from when I was a little girl. So you know all about the elves and fairies? Yes. I used to play with them when I was little. Sally! Now I remember you. It was years ago! Yes, there was you and naughty Prince Thistle-- King Thistle now. Nanny Plum! We must never talk to big grownups. Oh, hello, Wise Old Elf. Nice to see you again. Oh! Hello, Sally. Did you know the Wise Old Elf when he was very young? No. He's always been old. And wise. (trumpeting) (laughing) You haven't changed a bit. Oh, thank you. So it's the Little Kingdom where Dad's putting the cows. (all): Yes! Then we must stop him. Come on, everyone! Stop! Stop! What? We have to find somewhere else to put the cows. Uh... why? Because... uh... because the grass here is a bit, um, dry and, uh... And the ground is, uh, too muddy. There must be a better place to put the cows. No! This is the perfect place. The plan's not working! Uh... who said that? Now what do we do? Is it frog time? No, Nanny! What? Frog time! Ah! Don't let the farmer know we're here! Okay, clever clogs, what's your plan, then? Um, hello? We'll be with you in a moment. Now, Nanny Plum, as I was saying... Um... who are you all? Hello, Mr. Farmer. We're elves and fairies. And we live here in the meadow. Elves and fairies? Living in the meadow? (all): Yes! So we can't put the cows here, darling. Well, of course not. I don't want to knock anyone's house down. (all): Hurray! And one more thing, Dad. You must not tell any of your friends that you've seen elves and fairies. Hmm. Don't worry. There is no way that I will tell any of my friends that I've been seeing elves and fairies. Thank you, Dad. Good news, Your Majesty. There will be no cows in the meadow. So what's the bad news? The farmer, his wife and just about everybody now know about elves and fairies. I see. Hopefully, they don't know too much. And over here is the Little Castle, where the fairies live! (all): Hello! Uh... hello. Next up on your tour: the secret Elf Tree. See all the secrets the elves have been hiding for years. (narrator): Today's adventure starts... at the Little Castle. Good morning, Your Majesties. Good morning, Nanny Plum. Princess Holly would like to show you how well she is doing with her magic. Yes, I would! That's lovely, sweetie! She will now cast a spell for you. It's not magic jelly, is it? No, no! Not magic jelly. You can choose! What would you like best in the whole wide world? Could you make me something pretty? Okay. Abraca-dabbity-bobbity-boo! (burping) (screaming) What is it? It seems to be a box of burps, Your Majesty. (burping) Ah! That's disgusting! Sorry, Daddy. I think it's about time Holly had some proper magic lessons. Very good, Your Majesty. I'll just fetch my wand. No, Nanny Plum. I mean proper lessons at a proper school. School? Yes. Holly is old enough to go to Mrs. Fig's Magic School. Ooh, Mrs. Fig's Magic School! I went there when I was little. It sounds fun! Can my friends come as well? Of course! Violet, Rosie, Strawberry and Fleur can go to magic school too. Can Ben come along? Oh. Remember, Ben is an elf. And elves don't like magic. Ben will most likely be at elf school today. Good morning, children. (kids): Good morning, Wise Old Elf! This morning's lesson is called: Why elves don't do magic. Who can tell me why elves don't do magic? Because we're elves! (trumpeting) Yes, Ben. But can anyone tell me why we don't do magic? Because we're elves! (trumpeting) Yes, yes, I know. But why don't we? Is it because magic always leads to trouble? Yes, Jake. Magic always leads to trouble. This way, girls! And talking of trouble... Hello, Wise Old Elf! Hi, Ben! Hi, Holly! We're going to magic school! Ooh! Can we go to the magic school, too, Wise Old Elf? No, I forbid it. Oh, please, Wise Old Elf? (all): Please? Please? Oh, very well. Today's lesson will be: To see how magic always leads to trouble. (laughter) This way to the magic school! Ha! Magic school. I suppose it'll be all pink and fluffy and covered in glitter. That sounds nice! (owl hooting) Here we are. Mrs. Fig's Magic School. Oh, what a sensible building. It could've been built by an elf. I know, it's a bit ugly, isn't it? It's very sensible. Now, girls and boys, you'll soon be meeting Mrs. Fig. She taught me everything I know. (kids): Ooh! Mrs. Fig liked me. I used to call her \"Old Figgy.\" (laughter) Good morning, children. (all): Morning, Old Figgy! My name is Mrs. Fig. (all): Morning, Mrs. Fig. That's better. Hello, Figgy! Remember me? Ah. Nanny Plum. How could I forget? I told you I was her best pupil. In all my years of teaching, Nanny Plum, I never had another pupil like you. Thank you. And I am the Wise Old Elf. (trumpeting) Elves at magic school? Yes. We're here to see the magic all go wrong. Nothing will go wrong at Mrs. Fig's Magic School. Now, who do we have here? I'm Princess Holly. Princess Holly, what do you and your little friends know about magic? Oh, I've taught them lots of things! Let's say you know nothing. Now, what's the most important rule of magic? Don't do magic. Correct! What? But where's the fun in that? Magic is not meant to be fun. Ho-ho-ho! I like this lesson. Magic is only meant to be used for sensible things by sensible people. Now, pretend you're in the kitchen doing the washing up. Are you going to wash the dirty dishes using magic? Yes! Stop! That's just the sort of thing you can do by hand! (fairies): What?! That's just plain wrong. - But if you come across a particularly stubborn stain on a saucepan, then perhaps you could-- Use magic! --leave it to soak overnight. Why not just magic the whole lot clean and get on with something fun? I am the teacher, Nanny Plum. Sorry... Figgy. And now for the magic lesson. (kids): Hurray! First, we have to warm up. Let's start with a little jog! Oh, not the jogging. Outside! Chop-chop! Run around, everyone! What does running have to do with magic? Nothing. It builds character! I don't need any more character, thank you. Are you all having fun? (all): Yes! Right, stop! Jogging is not meant to be fun. (panting) Now, who would like to show me their favourite spell? Me! Anyone else? I can do a growing spell! Very good. Show us your growing spell, please. Okay. Babbety-bobbety-bo, grow, grow, grow! Ah! Not me! (screaming) She's just growing and growing. Stop it! Stop it! I know how to do growing, but not stopping. That's easy! Stop, Figgy, stop! And who taught you that growing spell? Me. I might have known. Well, it did work. You grew a lot! I know a spell to make things smaller. Wait! Don't! Dibbly-dobbly-dorl, small, small, small. (screaming) Mrs. Fig is still shrinking! Help! Help! She's getting teenier and teenier. She's never going to stop shrinking. Help! Help! (sighing) I'd better grow her again. Figgy, Figgy Fig, back to big. How are you feeling? I am very, very, very angry! So as you see, children, magic always leads to trouble. They were two very silly spells. Can anyone think of a useful spell? Magic jelly! Magic jelly? Yes. That's very useful. I suppose magic jelly has its uses. Like at a children's party. Or a picnic! Or as a yummy pudding. Okay, magic jelly. But let's get someone sensible to wave the wand. (all): Me! Me! I'll do it! Who is the most sensible person here? The Wise Old Elf! Then the Wise Old Elf shall wave the wand. Me? But I'm not a fairy. I don't do magic! Exactly! The perfect person. Oh, I don't think so. No, ho-ho! It wouldn't be right. Nonsense! We just need a bit of fairy dust. You are now magical! My body is all tingly. I don't like it. Don't worry. You won't be magical for very long. Just wave the wand and say, \"Jelly, jelly, but not a lot.\" Uh... jelly, jelly, but not a lot. (all gasping) Oh! It worked! Can I turn Nanny Plum into a frog? Ha! I'd like to see you try. (croaking) I say, this is fun! Uh... what happened? (laughing) Wise Old Elf, what are you doing? Having fun! Magic is not meant to be fun! What would happen if I asked for a lot of jelly? Try it and see. Jelly, jelly, jelly! And lots of it! No! Stop! We don't want a-- Jelly flood! (kids laughing) (all): Jelly flood! Jelly flood! Ah! Jelly flood! (laughter) Nanny Plum! It wasn't me, it was him! That's ridiculous! Elves don't do magic! Actually, Your Majesty, it was the Wise Old Elf. Even Old Figgy telling tales now! It's true! The Wise Old Elf did it. Oh, dear. I believe I did do the spell. Fancy that. The Wise Old Elf doing magic. Ha! You have been naughty. Yes. And it just goes to show that magic always leads to trouble.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-Y","Word Count":2587,"Year Published":2019,"Season & Episode":"S02E02"},"example_id":"21d92a71-6ef7-4404-9bd9-522031a6b469","annotations":[{"end":14,"tag":"Normative Feature","start":8,"value":"pretty","tag_id":"81d95dea-443c-4f17-9c59-090e5377b894","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"21d92a71-6ef7-4404-9bd9-522031a6b469","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T06:20:01.223+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:47:37.126+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:47:38.688+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"3eb5f504-e81b-4281-988c-2654b79e6247"}],"classifications":[]},{"content":"That talked like a human?","seen_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","annotator_id":5}],"comments":[],"metadata":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"Ease":52.55,"Genre":null,"Grade":7.8,"Notes":null,"Title":"Sudha Murty's Stories of Wit and Magic","Author":null,"Source":"Netflix","Age Max":12,"Age Min":7,"Content":"Hi. Hi, I am Sudha Murty, and I welcome you to my house of stories. Today's story is, \"The Golden Fish And Demon\". Once upon a time, in a faraway village, there was a fisherman named Suraj. He lived with his wife Laxmi at the seashore. He used to go fishing on his boat everyday. He would catch as many fish as he could in his small net. They were enough for his daily use. I work all day. I am a woman, but my condition is worse than that of a monster. Are you back from fishing? Come and eat whatever I have cooked. What happened, my queen Laxmi? Why are you always so angry? I am a woman, but my condition is worse than that of a monster. I don't know why my parents married me off to you. I work all day and can't even sleep properly at night. I am a woman, but my condition is worse than that of a monster. Fate has written something for everyone, Laxmi. Be grateful that we have a house to live in, clothes to wear and bread to eat. We should be thankful for all that. Listen, there is no firewood for the cooking stove. Bring some on your way back in the evening. Don't forget, or you won't get anything to eat. Some days are just bad, I caught no fish. Let me try again. The sun is about to set, it is time to go home. If I do not catch any fish today, Laxmi will be furious. O Sun, please help me catch at least one fish. Dear Lord, a golden fish! I have never seen a fish like that. Hey, fisherman! Dear Lord! Hey, fisherman! Fisherman, let me go back into the sea. I shall give you anything you want in return. But let me go back into the sea. Y-You can talk? Yes, and I have magical powers too. I shall give you anything you want, just let me go. The poor fish looks so sad. It's lying that it knows magic, just so that I don't take it. I have never seen a golden fish like you before, a talking one at that. You are special. It won't be right to take you, sell you or eat you. Go back home, to your family. You are free now, golden fish. Thank you for sparing me, fisherman. I will never forget your kindness. Tell me your wish, I will fulfill it immediately. You're a good man, fisherman. I understand, you don't want anything. But if you ever want anything, come to the sea and say, \"O little golden fish, o queen of the waters, come to the surface and listen to my wish.\" And I shall come and fulfill your wish. Listen, there is no firewood for the cooking stove. Bring some on your way back in the evening. Don't forget, or you won't get anything to eat. Laxmi needs firewood to cook. Your wish is granted. You'll find wood at home. While going home, Suraj wondered if the golden fish would be able to keep its promise. He was worried, what if the fish didn't keep its promise? Firstly, Laxmi would never believe him. And secondly, she would yell at him. Today was a really bad day. He should have collected some wood on his way back. Lost in such thoughts, Suraj came home. But as he took a look at his house, he saw that there was a big pile of wood right outside. He couldn't believe his eyes at first. Then he started dancing with delight. This is amazing! The wood is really here. Laxmi, come here! Look at this pile of wood, Laxmi! What happened? Why do you bray like a donkey? Look at this, Laxmi, so much wood! So what? It is not the first time you have brought it. Yes, it is a bit more than usual. Listen to me, and believe what I say. Today I caught a golden fish. A fish that talked like humans. It told me that if I let it go, it'd fulfill all my wishes. I let it go, and it asked me my wish. I remembered that you had asked for firewood to cook food. So, it slipped out of my mouth. It said that my wish will be granted. And now look, we have so much wood at home. You caught a golden fish? Yes. That talked like a human? Yes, yes. That can fulfill our wishes? Yes, Laxmi, I swear. And you asked for wood! You asked me to get it. So I asked for it. You stupid fisherman! Can wood fill our bellies? If this fish thing is true, you should go immediately and ask it for bags of flour, lentils and rice. Ask for some food. But... Go! Before that fish vanishes, go. Y-Yes... What did the fish say? Yes! O little golden fish, o queen of the waters, come to the surface and listen to my wish. O little golden fish, my wife is not happy with the wood you gave us. She said that she needs groceries too. Lentils, rice, flour, etc. Your wish is granted. You'll find groceries at home. Suraj came home quickly. And he saw that his house was lined with bags of grain. That was enough for months. Now his wife Laxmi was also very happy. There was peace at home now. But only for a few days. And one day, Laxmi was invited to a party by her friend in the neighboring village. Look at this sari, it is so old. It looks battered, my friends will laugh at me. I am a woman, but my condition is worse than that of a monster. Of what use are the bags of grain? They cannot be worn. Listen, go to that golden fish and ask her for some nice clothes. What are you saying? Where will I find it now? Why? It did tell you that you can ask for whatever you want. At least go and try. Will you keep applying oil or go already? I am a woman, but my condition is worse than that of a monster. Okay, I am going. I cannot win an argument against you. Hey, listen. What? Who? Where? It is me. I was wondering, what good is this wood, this food, what good are these pretty clothes, when we can't even sleep properly at home? We should at least have a big house. Go to that golden fish and make a wish for a beautiful house. Enough, Laxmi. I cannot do this anymore. Why can't you? You have a golden chance, and you're willing to lose it! Are you listening or pretending to be asleep? I am a woman, but my condition is worse than that of a monster. Do I have to go now, at night? Yes, right now. This way, we'd have a bungalow overnight. That would be fun. I am beautiful, but why don't I look pretty? This silk sari is also beautiful, but something's missing. Why the long face? When we get everything without lifting a finger, we don't feel inspired to do anything. I'm bound to feel sad. Let me give you some work. Go to that fish and say that I don't have any gold or silver jewelry. I am a woman, but my condition is-- That's enough, Laxmi. I'm not going to ask for anything anymore. This is the last time. We won't ask for anything anymore. The last time? Of course. What else would we need if we have jewelry? And yes, make sure the necklace has diamonds. It would be good if it is expensive. Go now, hurry. Laxmi, you look so beautiful, this mirror could break. Oh, my God! Who is there? Shoo, you wretched cat! Hey, listen! What now? You have everything. What more do you want? Do you even use your brain? We have gotten rich. We have so much gold and such valuables in our house. We'd lose everything if someone robs or steals from us. We will be poor again. I am a woman, but my condition is... No, I am a rich woman now. So, what should we do now? I'll tell you. Go to that fish and say... that we need a security guard who is tall, muscular, and dangerous. Someone who's so scary that he could scare away anyone who looks at him. If he is here, no one would dare come into my home and steal from me. But Laxmi-- This is a matter of our safety, dear. You have to ask for it. Go, this is my order. She is getting greedier. Okay, I am going. But this really is the last time. Suraj was shocked to see this dramatic side of Laxmi's. But what could he do? He went to the golden fish and called it. O little golden fish, o queen of the waters, come to the surface and listen to my wish. What is it, Suraj? What do you want now? O little golden fish, I did not want to come to you, but my wife sends me against my wish, again and again. This is probably the last time. I am moving far from here. So, tell me what your wife wants now. My wife has said that she needs a security guard who is tall and muscular, very dangerous and so scary that he scares people away, and no one would dare come near the house and steal anything. Your wish is granted. You will find a security guard at home who is tall, muscular, scary, and dangerous. Why do I feel strange? The person will be very dangerous. So scary... that people will run away looking at it. Because of that, nobody would dare come near your house or steal from you. Go, Suraj, goodbye. Do you know what happened then? When the poor Suraj got home, he was frightened. What is that noise? Laxmi! Laxmi! There was a scary, hairy monster standing in front of the house. Tall and muscular, with long teeth and nails. She even had a pair of horns on her head. M-Monster! Run! Hey, listen. Laxmi? I'm not a woman anymore. My condition is like that of a monster. How did this happen? Your golden fish deceived me. She made me a real monster so no one would come near the house, fearing me. Go, go quickly to that golden fish. Don't just stand here. Ask it to make me normal again. Even if it wants back everything it gave us. Go quickly! Suraj went to the sea and called for the golden fish again and again. O little golden fish, o queen of the waters, come to the surface and listen to my wish. But it didn't come. No one saw the golden fish and Suraj ever again. The villagers avoided that house now, because a monster lived there. A rich, greedy monster with no friends. Wasn't the story interesting? So, tell me what we learn from this story. Absolutely. Avarice is the root of all evils. And greed knows no bounds. However little we earn from our hard work is better. Will you remember this? I bid you adieu. See you next time with a new story and a new lesson in my house of stories.

The gross ones are the best! the best performers. But not always If I've done my calculations right, putting your own spin on these will get you huge exposure. Hmm, some of these look fun, Teresa, but I've never really cared about numbers. D-don't really care about numbers? They're only the epicenter the entire universe! for understanding There's a lot of funny stuff here. I'd totally be down to try some of it. Really? You guys would help? Of course! Sure! Looks cool.

Gotta take that one one step at a time. guaranteed viral sensation... It all builds to your next a lip dub. A lip dub? Uh, yeah, that might be kinda cool, but it's not really my-- You wanna be Internet famous, you gotta give the people what they want! Did I want to be famous? I was gonna tell Teresa I didn't, but, to be fair, there was a time when I did think about it. Da-da-da-da! Well? Humph. [applause and cheers on computer] You're too kind, really. Oh, please! I told myself I was just going with the flow cause everyone seemed so excited. But maybe there was a tiny piece of me that did want to be Internet famous. You know what, it's not fair. Roberts' stupid video with her friends is going viral. Can you move a bit to the left? There's a glint off that raspberry jam that's sort of magical. Okay. Making a viral video's not so hard. We can totally do it. Ah, twins, I got it. What if we made our own viral video? Didn't I just-- All we need is an awesome, epic idea. Uh... Uh... : OK. So if we took-- No, that's already been done.

Okay, you three ready for Got it. Yup! Sounds good. The light's a little better. Wait! Over there. Okay. Uh, you know, Teresa, we're taking this a little-- I just wonder if maybe I know what you mean. For granted? It's all happening so quickly, it's sort of hard to process how amazing it is. But I am truly grateful, I want you to know that. using my natural skills I mean, here I am, in the real world! And getting immediate quantifiable results! How cool is that? I mean, very cool. Uh, pretty cool! It's great. Okay then, on we go. Um, Renee, this is supposed to be the \"invisible\" box challenge. But it works so much better like this! See? Ah, whoa, ah! Maybe I'd better sit this one out. Okay, people, on three. One, two, three! Ha! Whoo! Okay. Ha! Hoo! That's not so hard. Whoa! We could totally do that. Right? Go on! I got my phone right here! Uh... you go first. No... it's okay, you go. For once, I'll let you have the spotlight. I'll just watch from over here. Whoa! Ahh! Boo! What are you doing here? Teresa! Wake-up videos are totally trending. it gets so hot it's cold. Gotta jump on before Teresa, I need to sleep. We all do. The lip dub video is tomorrow. That's exactly why we can't lose momentum now! Don't worry, I'll go home, edit, and upload this. This stuff is gold! Great work! Okay, so this was now officially getting out of control. Teresa's greatest achievement. My vlog had become But she was so excited. What could I do? C'mon, Taffy. Outside. Morning! Hey, sleepyhead! Um, we're yarn-bombing the trampoline? I thought we were doing the lip dub today. I got Teresa to record that great happy screech of hers, playing around with it a little for a mix. It's pretty awesome. What are those for? Bowling pins. Teresa made some changes last night. technically this morning! Or, I guess, 1:00 am is Hey! When did you have the time to set all this up? After editing the wake-up video, possible endorsement deals and before lining up some for you! I have a very good feeling about Pork on a Fork. It's gonna be a thing. Or not. every other video or something. We just have to show you eating one in, like, Okay. We are going to rock this cone challenge. Ready? Yep! Totally. Mm. Yum. Ha-ha, my favorite. Rocky Road! The little marshmallows make all the difference. Cut! That's not how you do it. You're supposed to grab it like this. Okay. Oh! Brrr. So cold. Okay, I can't feel my fingers now. Ow! My ice cream! Numb, numb! I don't know about this. Teresa? Body Balloons are hilarious! I special ordered them just for this gag. Human Bowling! Ken! Chop-chop! Where are you? I'm literally right behind you. Oh! Uh, excellent. Okay. Practice run. Everybody ready? As ready as we can be! And... action! Whoa! Whoa! Ahh! That was awesome! Internet gold! We will never be that funny. Yeah! Oh, that's it! Take a hike. Who? Him? Or me? Both of you! Now! Him. But-- Argh! That was amazing! you knocked over the camera. Except the end part where Don't worry, you'll get it right next time! Next time? You know, Teresa, I-- I need to take five. Good idea. I need to figure out how to work some Pork on a Fork into it anyway. Barbie? Over here, please! : Ken! Hey, dude. Hey... dude? What are you doing out here? Trey's all bent out of shape because you're Internet famous and we're not. He can be really hard to talk to sometimes. I hear ya. I'm having a hard time talking to a friend right now, too. Yeah. We do the craziest stuff when we're scared how we really feel. to tell people delaying the trip to Fun Fling Like the time Daisy kept cause she was scared of messing up but couldn't admit it? Or, when you were trying to help out Renee with that Chinese New Year thing? all from my posts! Wait, those are You watch my vlog? Obvs. It's cool seeing someone just being honest. Tells me I'm not the only one who feels that way. Out of the mouths of dudes. This vlog was always about just connecting, by being open and upfront with you. But lately I wasn't even being open and upfront with my closest friends. I had to tell Teresa the truth. Thanks! That really helped clear up some stuff for me. For reals? Totally. Well, kinda feels good helping people. Nah. It passed. Oh, good! You're back. As soon as we get everyone into position, we'll take it again. Um, I don't want to take it again. Hmm. Limiting practice is risky, but it could convey a certain authenticity. No. I mean, I don't want to do the video at all. I want the vlog to go back to how it was. But we're literally standing at the threshold of stardom! Teresa, you know me. I was never in this for fame. I just want to share things about my life that I'm thinking about or struggling with, 'cause maybe someone else is too. And none of this is about that. Wow. How did I miss that? I'm sorry. I just really liked the idea of us being a team. We are! You guys, my family. You are my life! You're what I share. And... sometimes struggle with? I was struggling with me. It was fun at first, but it sort of got out of control and I didn't know how to stop it. I didn't want to be the party pooper. you are the party. Barbie Roberts, Always. Mm. Whoa, yeah! Can I be the ball this time? Whoo! I think we're gonna scrap this one, Renee. What? No lip dub? Aw, man. But Nikki just made us all matching hats! Maybe we can do the lip dub. You know what? Only, let's try it my way.

SO, CLASS, WE'VE TRAVELED FROM EARTH, AROUND THE SUN, AND NOW WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO-- MERCURY, THE CLOSEST PLANET TO THE SUN. WHEN I TELL MY CLASS, THEY'RE GONNA BE SO JEALOUS. Students: WOW! WE'RE LANDING! Ms. Frizzle: OF COURSE! Arnold: TOLD YOU, JANET. WE HARDLY WEIGH ANYTHING COMPARED TO MY OLD PLANET EARTH. I WONDER IF THAT MEANS THERE'S LESS GRAVITY PULLING ON US HERE. EXACTLY, KEESHA. GOOD THINKING. COME ALONG, CLASS. FOLLOW THE BOUNCING LIZARD. THIS WAY, PLEASE. BET I CAN JUMP HIGHER THAN YOU, DOROTHY ANN. YOU'RE ON! I WON FIRST PLACE IN MY CLASS JUMPING CONTEST. HERE'S MY BLUE RIBBON TO PROVE IT. WAIT TILL I TELL MY CLASS I WON THE JUMPING CONTEST ON MERCURY, TOO! BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA SAY? WHAT? PROVE IT! HOW ON EARTH-- I MEAN, HOW AM I GONNA PROVE I WAS ON MERCURY? Ralphie: MAN! THE ALIENS ON MERCURY SURE MAKE BIG FOOTPRINTS. NOTHING CAN LIVE ON MERCURY, RALPHIE. IT'S TOO HOT AND DRY DURING THE DAY. AND, ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH, WAY BELOW FREEZING AT NIGHT. AND DAY OR NIGHT, THERE'S NO AIR, WHICH MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT... TO BREATHE. WELL, SOMETHING HAD TO MAKE TRACKS THIS BIG. SOMETHING DID, RALPHIE. A METEORITE. METEORITES ARE PIECES OF STONE OR IRON THAT FALL FROM SPACE. COME ALONG, CLASS. Carlos: IF THE ONES THAT HIT THE PLANET ARE CALLED METEORITES, WHAT DO YOU CALL THE ONES THAT MISS? Wanda: WHAT? METEORWRONGS! WOW! JANET, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HEY! WATCH IT! EUREKA! MY VERY OWN METEORITE! WHEN I SHOW THIS TO MY CLASS, IT WILL PROVE I WAS ON MERCURY. OHH, JANET. RIDE 'EM, COWBUS! WA-HOO! Ms. Frizzle: WE ARE NOW APPROACHING-- Janet: VENUS, THE SECOND PLANET FROM THE SUN. I CAN'T WAIT! I CAN'T WAIT! I CAN'T WAIT! Wanda: COOL! VENUS HAS CLOUDS, JUST LIKE EARTH. WOW! WHAT A VIEW! UH, I THINK I'LL GO...SIT DOWN NOW. COME ALONG, CLASS. HEY! UNH! I FEEL LIKE I WEIGH THE SAME HERE AS I DO ON EARTH. THAT'S BECAUSE VENUS IS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS EARTH AND HAS ABOUT THE SAME GRAVITY. COME ON, ARNOLD. CHECK OUT THOSE WEIRD CLOUDS. OH, GOOD! A LITTLE RAIN WILL COOL THE PLACE DOWN! EXCEPT THAT'S NOT RAIN WATER IN THOSE CLOUDS, WANDA. IT'S SULFURIC ACID. SULFURIC ACID? MM-HMM. IT'S A DEADLY POISON. OH, WE'RE PERFECTLY SAFE AS LONG AS WE KEEP OUR SPACESUITS ON. I LIKE ROCKS, BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS. UNH! DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE ALL OF THESE? ABSOLUTELY. IF THIS DOESN'T PROVE I WAS ON VENUS, NOTHING WILL. Ms. Frizzle: WE'RE NOW PASSING THROUGH THE ORBIT OF THE THIRD PLANET, WHICH IS EARTH. Phoebe: LOOK. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. AND THERE'S AIR WE CAN BREATHE. Keesha: AND IT'S NOT TOO HOT OR NOT TOO COLD. Arnold: THE ONLY ONE THAT SUPPORTS LIFE. Janet: AND COMING UP IS MARS... THE FOURTH PLANET, RIGHT, MS. FRIZZLE? VERY GOOD, JANET. OOH, YOU CERTAINLY DO KNOW YOUR PLANETS. I GOT STRAIGHT As ON ALL MY REPORTS. All: WE KNOW! WE KNOW! ENOUGH ALREADY! Ms. Frizzle: AH, HERE WE ARE, CLASS. TAKE A LOOK AT MARS. HOW MARVELOUS! Tim: IT LOOKS LIKE THE WHOLE PLACE IS RUSTING. NO WONDER IT'S CALLED THE RED PLANET. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE SOIL HERE IS COLORED BY RED DUST, WHICH HAS IRON IN IT. LOOK AT THOSE CLIFFS OF ICE. Wanda: ICE CLIMBING, ANYONE? WOW! ALL RIGHT! NO, THANKS. TOO COLD, TOO SLIPPERY. TOO RIGHT. WHO WANTS TO WASTE TIME CLIMBING UP AN OLD ICECAP, ANYWAY? COME ON, CUZ. WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO! JANET, STOP! MAYBE I SHOULD'VE STAYED HOME TODAY. Wanda: WE'VE MADE IT TO THE TOP! Keesha: I WONDER IF MARS COULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER EARTH IF IT HAD WATER AND WASN'T SO COLD. HMM, MAYBE. BUT AS I ALWAYS SAY, MARS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR ICE CREAM. Ralphie: ICE CREAM? WHERE! HERE! I...SCREAM! WOO WOO WOO WOO! WOO WOO WOO! LET'S GO! All: I SCREAM! THAT'S THE LAST ICE BLOCK. GREAT! NOW FOR SOME RED DUST. ON EARTH, I HAD SIMPLE LITTLE CHORES-- EMPTYING WASTEBASKETS, FEEDING THE FISH, CLEARING THE TABLE. UNH! UNH! THE ONLY THING IS, WE'VE BEEN TO MERCURY, VENUS, AND MARS SO FAR. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN A SINGLE--UH! All: ALIEN! TELL IT WE SURRENDER! HI, GUYS. WHICH WAY'S THE BUS? All: ARNOLD! I KNEW IT WAS HIM THE WHOLE TIME. HA HA! AHEM. MARS ICE AND DUST. ENOUGH TO PROVE WE WERE ON MARS. NO NEED TO THANK ME. I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH CHANCE OF THAT, JANET. LOOK! A FLYING POTATO! Janet: THAT'S NO POTATO. IT'S AN ASTEROID, RALPHIE. A HUNK OF SPACE ROCK SMALLER THAN A MOON, BUT BIGGER THAN A METEORITE. Ms. Frizzle: IT'S PART OF THE ASTEROID BELT, A RING OF ASTEROIDS WHICH DIVIDES OUR SOLAR SYSTEM INTO THE INNER AND OUTER PLANETS. WHOA! WHOA! WHAT HAPPENED? AN ASTEROID! HA HA! I'VE GOT TO HAVE ONE! PLEASE. IT WILL ONLY TAKE ME A SECOND. WATCH OUT! Ralphie: WHAT WAS THAT? Dorothy Ann: WHAT HAPPENED? Phoebe: WHAT'S GOING ON? Ms. Frizzle: DON'T WORRY, CLASS. JUST AN UNEXPECTED ORBITAL INTERRUPTION. LET'S JUST SEE WHERE WE ARE, SHALL WE? THE MAP! IT'S GONE! WE'RE LOST IN SPACE! Students: WE'RE LOST IN SPACE! AS I ALWAYS SAY, THERE'S NOTHING A GOOD SPACE MECHANIC CAN'T FIX. WRENCH. WRENCH. PLIERS. UH! AN ASTEROID. I MEAN, PLIERS. SCREWDRIVER. AN ASTEROID. PERFECT PROOF! Tim: MS. FRIZZLE, WE'VE GOT HALF OF THE MAP NOW. GOOD. ONE MORE ADJUSTMENT. OOPS! MS. FRIZZLE! MS. FRIZZLE! MS. FRIZZLE! MS. FRIZZLE! KEEP YOUR CLAW ON THAT BUTTON, LIZ. UP, UP, AND AWAY! UM, HEH HEH. BAD NEWS. JANET, WE'RE NOT ONLY LOST IN SPACE... WE'RE LOST IN SPACE WITHOUT A TEACHER! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? MS. FRIZZLE TO CLASS. MS. FRIZZLE TO CLASS. COME IN. NO REASON TO PANIC. I'D NEVER LEAVE YOU. I'M RIGHT HERE. I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT. I'M HEADED FOR ONE OF THE OUTER PLANETS. Tim: BUT THAT'S THE HALF OF THE MAP THAT WE DON'T HAVE. Ms. Frizzle: HA HA! GOOD. YOU CAN FILL IT IN AS YOU GO ALONG. YOU'VE GOT A NAVIGATOR WHO KNOWS THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE DO? Ms. Frizzle: OF COURSE--JANET. Keesha: I WONDER IF MS. FRIZZLE'S DOWN THERE. Tim: WOW! WHICH PLANET IS THAT? Janet: ONE OF THE GAS GIANTS. Keesha: WHAT IS THAT RED BLOTCH? Janet: IT'S A STORM THOUSANDS OF MILES WIDE. AND THE ONLY PLANET WITH A BIG RED SPOT IS JUPITER. Dorothy Ann: JUPITER, THE FIFTH PLANET. Students: ALL RIGHT, JANET! WAY TO GO! NOW, IF I COULD JUST GET SOME OF THAT RED SPOT, IT WOULD PROVE I'VE BEEN TO JUPITER. MS. FRIZZLE TO BUS. MS. FRIZZLE TO BUS. OVER. JUPITER IS THE LARGEST PLANET. BUT DON'T WORRY, CARLOS, BECAUSE I'M NOT ON IT. THEN WHERE ARE YOU? I'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME OF THAT RED SPOT! Carlos: WE'RE OUT OF CONTROL! JANET, PULL UP! PULL UP! IT'S ALL YOURS, RALPHIE. WHOA! All: JANET! CHILL OUT, GUYS. IF YOU VISIT JUPITER, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE PROOF, RIGHT? I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME TODAY. MS. FRIZZLE TO CLASS. MS. FRIZZLE TO CLASS. COME IN, PLEASE. MS. FRIZZLE, JANET ALMOST GOT US-- I GOT THEM SOME OF JUPITER'S RED SPOT. DID YOU SAY \"RED HOT\"? YOU'RE NOT EVEN WARM YET. THE OUTER PLANET I'M ON IS VERY COLD AND DARK. THE COLDER YOU GET, THE WARMER YOU'LL BE TO FINDING ME. OH, GREAT. NOW IT'S A RIDDLE. OFF WE GO AGAIN. Dorothy Ann: HEY, LOOK! ANOTHER PLANET! Phoebe: IT'S BEAUTIFUL! Keesha: BUT WHERE ARE WE? Janet: IT'S GOT TO BE SATURN. THERE'S NO OTHER GAS GIANT WITH SUCH BEAUTIFUL RINGS. SATURN, THE SIXTH PLANET. Keesha: WELL, IT MUST BE COLD DOWN THERE BECAUSE SATURN IS PRETTY FAR AWAY FROM THE SUN. BUT MS. FRIZZLE SAID COLD AND DARK. IT COULD BE VERY, VERY DARK ON SATURN. OH, NO, YOU DON'T! YOU JUST WANT TO GRAB MORE STUFF. HEY! I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY \"LET'S FIND MS. FRIZZLE WITHOUT A MAP\" FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, THAT'S FINE WITH ME. HMPH. JANET'S RIGHT. MS. FRIZZLE COULD BE ON SATURN, COULDN'T SHE? OK, ARNOLD, BUT IT'S YOUR JOB TO KEEP YOUR CRAZY COUSIN UNDER CONTROL. MS. FRIZZLE TO BUS. MS. FRIZZLE TO BUS. OVER? LIZ AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW YOU ALL THE STARS WE CAN SEE OUT HERE. OH, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. COME BACK! WHAT ABOUT A HINT? SHE JUST GAVE US A HINT, RALPHIE. Ralphie: SHE DID? YEAH! SHE CAN SEE THE STARS, WHICH MEANS SHE CAN'T BE ON SATURN. SHE COULD NEVER SEE THE STARS THROUGH ALL THOSE STORMS AND CLOUDS. PLANET NUMBER 7 COMING UP. Janet: THAT MUST BE URANUS. YOU CAN TELL BY ITS TILTED, FAINT-GRAY RINGS AND ITS BLUE-GREEN GASES. SEE, CUZ, URANUS DOESN'T DO A THING FOR ME. SO YOU CAN GET OFF ME, OK? SORRY, JANET, BUT I HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF THE SITUATION. Tim: THE FRIZ COULDN'T SEE THE STARS THROUGH THOSE CLOUDS, EITHER. Phoebe: NO WAY SHE'S ON URANUS. TO THE NEXT PLANET! Janet: WAIT! I NEED PROOF! AND WE NEED MS. FRIZZLE! STEP ON IT, WANDA! HEY, WATCH IT! Janet: NEPTUNE! PLEASE! WE GOT TO STOP AT NEPTUNE! IT'S MY FAVORITE PLANET! Dorothy Ann: THE EIGHTH PLANET--NEPTUNE. Tim: LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER PLANET SURROUNDED BY GASES. Phoebe: AND IT'S BLUE. BLUE! MY FAVORITE COLOR! FORGET IT, JANET. MS. FRIZZLE COULDN'T SEE THE STARS FROM DOWN THERE. GO, WANDA! Janet: NO! NOW WHERE DO WE GO? SHE'S NOT ON JUPITER, SATURN, URANUS, OR NEPTUNE. THAT MEANS THERE'S ONLY ONE PLANET LEFT. Tim: WHICH ONE? I'LL TELL YOU AFTER ARNOLD GETS OFF OF ME! RIGHT. LISTEN CAREFULLY. MS. FRIZZLE IS ON THE FARTHEST PLANET FROM THE SUN-- PLUTO. Wanda: TO PLUTO! Dorothy Ann: PLUTO IS COLD AND DARK, ALL RIGHT. Carlos: AND CLEAR! THEY'VE GOT TO BE HERE. Ralphie: LOOK! Phoebe: THERE THEY ARE! All: YAY! GOOD WORK, CLASS! WE KNEW YOU'D FIND US, RIGHT, LIZ? SURE CAN SEE THE STARS FROM HERE. I WONDER WHERE THE SUN IS. SEE THAT TINY STAR OVER THERE? UH-HUH. WELL, THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE SUN? MM-HMM. NO WONDER PLUTO'S SO COLD AND DARK. LOOK HOW FAR AWAY THE SUN IS. SO THE COLDER WE GOT, THE WARMER WE GOT TO FINDING YOU. IT WAS A GOOD HINT, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF. I GOT ENOUGH STUFF FOR ALL OF US TO PROVE WE MADE IT TO PLUTO. All: HUH? WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? LET'S GO. ARE YOU KIDDING? THERE'S NO ROOM IN THERE! ALL RIGHT. BE THAT WAY. WHOA! THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING HOME WITHOUT MY STUFF. THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING HOME WITHOUT YOU. IT'S PROOF! NOBODY WILL BELIEVE ME WITHOUT IT. I'LL BELIEVE YOU. THEY'LL BELIEVE YOU. JANET, YOU WANT PROOF? I'LL GIVE YOU PROOF. HERE'S PROOF OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOU IF YOU STAY HERE WITH YOUR STUFF! ARNOLD, NO! OH, CUZ! BACK TO EARTH! AND STEP ON IT! THANKS, JANET. ARNOLD, IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO. IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU, I'D STILL BE ON PLUTO WITH ALL MY STUFF. I DON'T NEED TO PROVE ANYTHING. THAT WAS THE MOST AMAZING FIELD TRIP EVER! YOU KNOW IT. I KNOW IT. IF NO ONE ELSE BELIEVES ME, THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM. RIGHT ON! Wanda: WAY TO GO, JANET! Tim: YOU SAID IT. Boy: ATTENTION, ALL STUDENTS! WE'VE JUST LEARNED THAT SCIENTISTS HAVE MADE THEIR FIRST CONTACT WITH AN ALIEN FROM OUTER SPACE. AN ALIEN. WOW! RALPHIE WAS RIGHT. OH, MY. THE ALIEN, CLAIMING TO BE FROM PLUTO, HAS CALLED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A PILE OF LITTER THAT WAS RECENTLY DUMPED ON HIS PLANET. All: RALPHIE! HA HA HA! AS I ALWAYS SAY, CLASS, YOU'RE OUT OF THIS WORLD. IS THIS THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS? IS THIS THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS? Overlapping voices: IS THIS THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS? MAGIC SCHOOL BUS? MAGIC SCHOOL BUS? Both: MAGIC SCHOOL BUS? Overlapping voices: MAGIC SCHOOL BUS? Kids: I WANT THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS! HELLO? MAGIC SCHOOL BUS. Female voice: DON'T YOU MEAN \"THE TWILIGHT ZONE\"? THAT SHOW HAD MORE SCIENCE FICTION THAN FACT. WELL, WE REALIZE A SCHOOL BUS WOULD MAKE A LOUSY SPACECRAFT. I'LL GIVE YOU THAT ONE, BUT ONLY BECAUSE YOU CALL IT A MAGIC SCHOOL BUS. BUT THERE'S NO WAY ANY SPACECRAFT COULD VISIT ALL 9 PLANETS IN A DAY. WELL, IF WE DID IT IN REAL TIME, YOU WOULD BE A GROWNUP BY THE TIME WE GOT TO PLUTO. SPEAKING OF PLUTO, SCIENTISTS DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT ITS SURFACE IS LIKE. YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT UNTIL ONE OF YOU KIDS GROWS UP TO BE AN ASTRONOMER OR AN ASTRONAUT AND FIGURES OUT WHAT PLUTO IS LIKE, WE HAVE TO GUESS. ALSO, PLUTO RIGHT NOW ISN'T THE NINTH PLANET FROM THE SUN. UNTIL 1999, IT'S TEMPORARILY INSIDE NEPTUNE'S ORBIT. RIGHT AGAIN. WHAT ABOUT THOSE FUNNY-LOOKING SUN GOGGLES? I HAPPEN TO KNOW YOU SHOULD NEVER LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN. HURTS YOUR EYES. YOU'RE ONE BRIGHT KID. SO HOW COME SOME OF THE TIME THE KIDS WERE FLOATING AROUND IN THE BUS? WELL, WHEN THE BUS WAS COASTING WITH THE ROCKET ENGINES OFF, THEY WERE WEIGHTLESS, LIKE ASTRONAUTS. OH, YEAH. SO HOW COME THEY WERE ABLE TO WALK AROUND IN THE BUS SOMETIME? WELL, WOULD YOU, UH... BELIEVE AN ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY GEOSCOPIC CONFABULATOR? HA HA HA! NO WAY. OK, YOU GOT ME. WE JUST FUDGED IT. AND DON'T THINK I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT YOU HAD ALL THE PLANETS LINED UP IN A NEAT LITTLE ROW. OH, THAT. WELL, IT'S TRUE THAT PLANETS ARE VERY RARELY ALL LINED UP LIKE THAT. YEAH. LIKE, ALMOST NEVER. BUT IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM ALL THAT WAY. YOU WOULDN'T WANT US TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ONE, WOULD YOU? AND ANOTHER THING: IF AN ASTRONAUT EVER DOES MAKE IT TO PLUTO, SHE'D BETTER NOT TAKE HER HELMET OFF. YOU THINK THEY'D END UP WITH MORE THAN A COLD, HUH? SHE'D END UP A BLOCK OF ICE, OR WORSE, WHICH REMINDS ME WHY I CALLED IN THE FIRST PLACE. YES? I'M STILL WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO GET THAT PILE OF LITTER OFF MY PLANET. SURFIN' ON A SOUND WAVE SWINGIN' THROUGH THE STARS TAKE A LEFT AT YOUR INTESTINE TAKE YOUR SECOND RIGHT PAST MARS ON THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS NAVIGATE A NOSTRIL CLIMB ON THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS SPANK A PLANKTON, TOO ON OUR MAGIC SCHOOL BUS RAFT A RIVER OF LAVA ON THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS SUCH A FINE THING TO DO!

It's good to see you. Hi! Where've you been these past weeks? Oh, I see... You've been on holidays. I bet you can't wait to tell your friends all about it. And here's Pato, also back from holidays too. -How nice! Quack! You and Pocoyo will have plenty to talk about. Quack, quack, quack! And so will you, Elly! Holidays are over for everyone. Time for a reunion. Quack! Home at last. -Well, it's good to be together again. Pato! Aww, Elly! Very nice. And Sleepy Bird, too! Well now, let's hear what you each did on your holidays. Who wants to start? -Pato perhaps? Quack! Oh, a trip to the beach! And you built a sand castle there. Then you went fishing. Quack, quack! What's that? The fish was bigger than that? Quack, quack! Still not big enough? Quack, quack, quack! Now? Tremendous! Ah, you had some fun in the snow, Elly! Let's hear all about it. You met some new friends. And you built a big snowman together. My! That is big. And you practiced jumps with your snowboard. How cool is that! What's that? The jump was higher? This high? You jumped so far you even had time to read. And do some yoga. And even have a tea party. Why, that's unbelievable! And it looks like Pocoyo and Pato might agree with me. OK, OK, Elly. Let's hear your story, Pocoyo. You went flying to outer space. You flew past some amazing planets. A lettuce planet? Sounds very healthy. And a strawberry planet? Delicious. Until you got to a planet made of cake and giant candy? Are you quite sure, Pocoyo? You seem to have had a lot of fun there, Pocoyo. And then... you ate the whole planet?! Yeah! Well! Did that really happen? I'm not sure the others buy your tale, Pocoyo. What about your holidays, Sleepy Bird? What did you do? That just might be the most wonderful holidays of all of them. Mine... best. Hold on now. Must you all argue about your holidays? After all, it’s fun to share our holidays stories with our friends. Even if maybe some parts of the stories aren’t exactly how things happened. No! Come on now, Pocoyo. And really, the best part is that you're all here having fun together again. Off you go, time for play! Let's play! And no more tall tales. Bye-bye! Good. Bye-bye now! Ah, winter. Pocoyo, Pato and Elly are enjoying sledding! Hi, guys! Hi! What fun! Oh! Christmas bells. I wonder where those are coming from. Over there? Wow! Very good, Pocoyo, you've found the Christmas sound. Sleepy Bird's made her own Christmas tree! Quack! Well, it is Christmas time. Maybe you should get a tree of your own. What could he be looking for? Quack! What a mess! Well, he certainly seems determined to find it. Quack! Oh, I see! You'll cut down a tree for everyone! You've done it, Pato! You've found the perfect Christmas tree. All set to cut? Quack! Oh... Oh, dear... Seems he can't bear to harm such a perfect tree. But what to do now? Aha! Ah, it seems Pocoyo has an idea! So much old junk. It seems such a waste. Aha! Seeds! So that's what you were looking for. I see. You're going to use the seeds to grow a tree! Now we wait for it to grow. I'm afraid your tree may not sprout in time for Christmas. Wonderful! A new tree. This does seem magical. Hmm... It seems that this tree is too small to even decorate. What’s that, Elly? You have a plan? Oh, dear... You've all really created such a mess. Bravo! It looks like you have a Christmas tree after all! Ahh! Now what? More mess? I see your plan now. Very clever indeed! This is quite the magical Christmas after all. A very Merry Christmas to everyone! Bye-bye, now. Pocoyo and Elly and Pato! Hi! What's that you're playing? Marbles. Let's see. You need to get your marble into that small hole right there in the middle, right? And how is everyone doing? What about you, Pocoyo? That’s a special black super marble! Oh, I'm sorry Pocoyo, you almost had it. Well, whose turn is it now? Wait! What's happening? Yay! Yes, Pocoyo, but... how did your marble move all on its own? I think you've discovered a black hole. Quack! It'll suck up anything nearby. And you know what that means, don't you? Pocoyo... -This is no time for dancing. Quack? Now come on, get away from that hole! Good idea, Pato! Grab that tree! -Hold on everyone! This is rather funny, isn't it? But I'm afraid we have to get Elly out somehow. Quack! Quack! Quack? Can anyone switch on the light? Well, that's a relief, everything seems to be fine! Except for one minor detail. All the colours are reversed! Pato, you're not yellow anymore. Now you're purple! And Elly, now you're green! You'd like everything to go back to normal, wouldn't you? Well, maybe there’s a way. Are you thinking about how to get back to your world, Pocoyo? Well, you know, maybe your black super marble is the key. Maybe it can take you back home. -Yes, Elly, that's it! In this world, Pocoyo's black marble would be white! Now what? There you go. A white hole! Jump in everyone! But, Pato, don't you want to be yellow again? This certainly isn't your world. You're all made of paper! -You'd better find that marble. Quack! Good job, Pato! Oh, my... You're balloons now! Phew! You're back home, guys! You didn't leave anything behind, did you? That's a good question, Pato. What should you do with it? Aha! It looks like Pocoyo has an idea. A rocket? Oh, I see. Well, then I’d better start a countdown. Ready? Three, two, one! Blast off! Well, look at that! It's a magical night time! See you soon! Good morning, Pocoyo. Hi! Going for a walk, I see. Chicken eggs! How curious. I wonder where their mother's gone. Huh? How wonderful. But still no mother. You'd better take care of these chicks until she returns. Do you think you can do it? Yes! Pocoyo takes care. Huh? You’d better follow them, Pocoyo. Erm... Maybe it's time to teach them to roost. Very good. Looks like you could use some help, Pocoyo. Maybe Pato? No Pato! Elly \"help\" Pocoyo. Elly? I bet she'd make a wonderful mother. Elly, will you help Pocoyo mind these chicks? This is curious. Looks like someone's got those chicks in line. But who? It's Pato! What a surprise! You make a better mother hen than we thought! Amazing, you've done it! Quack! What’s next, Pato? Quack! Flying? But chickens don't fly. Quack! Unbelievable! You are a natural with these chicks. Well! You're just full of surprises, Pato! Quack! What could possibly be next? Oh, no, Pato! What happened to your flock of chicks? Quack? Oh, their mother's found them at last! Well, of course the chicks belong with their mother. Oh, dear. Perhaps some rest will do you good. There we are, Pato. Get a good night's rest. Quack! Well! It looks like you've made new friends for good. [overjoyed quacking Lovely. Good night, Pato.

I remember having it when we were on the bus. Then that means that it's… It's on the bus, huh? What should we do? Should we go after it? Okay, here's the Nakasugi Land bus schedule. Looks like the next one won't show up for another 45 minutes. So what now? Tokio, why don't you guys go ahead without me? I'm gonna stay right here and wait for the bus to come back. Um… Ha. I'll catch up with you all later. Here. Huh? Oh! Are you sure? It's all right. Go have a great time. How about we meet over there at lunchtime by that big parfait? Right over there? You got it.

I grew up in Hawaii. This was my backyard. My love of the natural world began here. When I was growing up, wild spaces and everyday spaces, they were one and the same. An essential part of our lives. I wanna make sure that the world's wild spaces are there for my kids and my grandkids. Join me in this celebration of our planet's greatest national parks and wilderness. A journey through the natural wonders of our shared birthright. My mom used to tell me that when she was pregnant, she'd come and sit and listen to the ocean and look at the waves lapping over the coral reefs. She used to joke that that was the reason I was so calm. I had spent a lot of time here even before I arrived in the world. When I was six, Hanauma Bay joined the growing number of protected wild spaces. What began as a common desire to secure wilderness for people to enjoy has become a worldwide movement to preserve these areas for future generations. They're a place to escape the burdens of everyday life and an inspiration for our children. They're a haven for endangered species… and a hotbed for scientific research. Not only do they nurture the greatest array of life on Earth… …they regulate our climate, clean our air, purify our water. When humanity started to protect these wild places, we did not realize how important they would become. Today, they are some of the last strongholds of wilderness and wildlife. Some remain so remote that we're only just starting to unravel their secrets. Take Loango National Park in Gabon on the west coast of Africa. It's a haven for tropical forest animals. Yet many of the creatures here are all drawn to the very same place. The beach. One of the last places where the vast Congo rain forest meets the Atlantic Ocean. Buffalo graze vegetation coated with sea salt… a mineral that's hard to find in the rain forest. A red river hog… with a craving for fresh seafood. African forest elephants come to the beach and mingle with marine giants. Like this one-ton leatherback turtle. And there's one creature here who's figured out how to make the most of all the seaside amenities. By day, hippos stick to freshwater lagoons. Sheltering from the sun. As evening approaches, they usually trek inland to favorite grazing grounds. But not this guy. He has other ideas. He heads straight for the surf! His three-ton frame feels lighter in salt water. The waves wash away parasites and soothe the scrapes and bruises of the day. There's nowhere else you'll see a hippo in the Atlantic Ocean. But he's not here just to take a dip. He wants to catch the waves. He rides the ocean swell north, up the coast. Until he reaches his favorite spot for dinner. Now that he's worked up an appetite, he'll spend the whole night grazing. As the sun sets all along this coastline, other hippos follow suit. Leaving their lagoons to hang ten. The surfing hippos of Loango. It just goes to show, the natural world can continue to surprise us as long as we give it space to thrive. Nature's remaining strongholds are often in areas that are difficult to reach, making national parks important and valuable sanctuaries for iconic animals, as well as rare and extraordinary creatures. On the other side of Africa, on the island of Madagascar, the remote Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park. This inaccessible stone fortress has given rise to species found nowhere else on Earth. A rock iguana, recently discovered and never filmed before. His long digits and claws help him grip the sheer rock face. The forest surrounding the peaks shelters rare creatures native only to the Tsingy. Including one of the park's most elusive residents. The Decken's sifaka. Many of these endangered lemurs call this park home. Like most primates, they spend much of their time in the safety of the trees. This small group has a new responsibility. At just eight weeks old, his strength will soon be put to the test. So Mom gives him lots of encouragement. Building his confidence to leave her side… and explore his new world. Climbing and jumping is the best training for life in this park. In time, he'll cover 30 feet in a single leap. Until then, it's baby steps. He may be undeterred by the oppressive heat, but the others save their energy by resting in the shade. It's the height of the dry season. Sifakas mostly rely on leaves for food and water. But resources in their patch of forest are running out. The only fresh food lies in small, shaded sanctuaries scattered between the peaks. The females decide it's time to make a move. A maze of craggy, razor-sharp spires lie between them and survival. Below, gaping chasms. Baby must use all his strength to cling on to Mom. His added weight means her every move requires pinpoint precision. A single misstep could prove fatal. It's a labyrinth, but they know a secret route. One day, he'll learn it too, but, for now, he just needs to hold on tightly. Expert hunters patrol the exposed rock. They shouldn't stay out here any longer. Mom makes one last push… …closing in on safety… until finally… they reach a sanctuary hidden between the rocks… full of juicy leaves. An epic and exhausting journey. One he'll repeat many times in the years to come. The more isolated the national park, the more unusual its creatures and the more extraordinary their behaviors. Which makes islands especially important to protect. Like this one in southern Japan. Home to Yakushima National Park and an ancient forest. Moss carpets the ground. Fig and banyan trees knit their roots through the landscape. Giant Japanese cedars, some over a thousand years old, tower high overhead. Isolation has shaped the creatures that live here. Many that live on islands are smaller than their mainland cousins. This sika deer is just three feet tall. His diet of dead leaves is filling, but it's not the tastiest. And it doesn't satisfy his sweet tooth. If only he could reach the fruits and berries high above. But there are windfalls in Yakushima. If you know where to find them. Japanese macaques. This is the gang he was hoping to find. Now, he just has to be patient. And the macaques are the key to the sweetest food in the forest. They say good things come to those who wait. All the deer know that these monkeys are messy eaters. The food they drop is packed with sugars. But there's only so much to go around. The deer make the most of the feast while it lasts. But a distracted stag becomes the perfect plaything. And it turns out, there's no such thing as a free lunch. In return for eating his fill, the deer is taken for a joyride. It's good to keep your allies on your side. But this is definitely the last stop. Our national parks do much more than provide wildlife with food and sanctuary. And we're still learning the true benefits of protecting wilderness. In 1872, Yellowstone, in the western United States, became the first national park in the world. Two million acres of wild space in the Rocky Mountains. Geologically active and spectacular. Home to the largest concentration of wildlife in the lower 48 states. One of America's greatest ideas. Established for the benefit and enjoyment of the people. And it caught on, sparking a global movement. Today, around 15% of land and nearly 8% of our oceans have been protected. Most of it in my lifetime. We've come to understand the true value of these last wild places and that what happens inside our parks affects us all. Take rain forests. They're home to more than half of all life on land. If you're not sure why this biodiversity is so important to protect, consider this. A quarter of all our medicines originated in rain forests. We're still discovering new medical advances hiding in plain sight. In Costa Rica's Manuel Antonio National Park, even familiar faces can surprise us. A three-fingered sloth enjoys the sun. With the slowest metabolism of any mammal, he can't afford to waste energy. But he's hungry. Fortunately, he doesn't have far to go. When it can take a month to digest a single leaf, you may as well look for just the right one. Like all sloths, he struggles to see. So he sniffs for the best leaves. Passing on the old ones. Until he finds perfection. But dinner is going to have to wait. The rain chills him. Unlike the monkeys, he can't warm up by moving quickly. But the rain forest provides the ideal sun chair, from which to perform a neat trick. He changes color, turning vivid green. It's algae so far found only on sloths that gives him his unique tinge. And that's not all. There's an entire micro kingdom living in his fur. At least 80 species call this place home… including sloth moths, who spend their adult lives on their gentle host. His perfect mix of thick, damp fur, warmed by the sun, ensures the little world inside his coat thrives. That's why scientists believe that this sloth could now benefit all of us. He's like a tiny pharmaceutical factory. Fungus in his fur produces chemicals that have the potential to fight cancer, malaria, and antibiotic-resistant superbugs. If we can protect him and his rain forest, this sleepy sloth might just save us all. To safeguard our parks and all their inhabitants, we must also protect the health of lands and waters beyond their borders. Because every protected wilderness, no matter how remote, is connected to the outside world… through the movements of wind, water, and wildlife. Over Australia's north coast, a quarter of a million magpie geese flock together… heading for Kakadu National Park. A landscape dominated by wetlands, rivers, and billabongs, where shifting waters shape the fortunes of all. In the dry season, the geese gorge on water chestnuts revealed in muddy shallows. But one animal's good fortune can be another's peril. Saltwater crocodiles, the world's largest reptiles. The dry season is a dangerous time for these predators. A 15-foot male trying to make his way to deeper water must cross a rival's patch. But it's worth taking the gamble. Crocs that don't move in time risk being entombed in the drying mud. But he makes it to the river system that connects Kakadu to the sea. Now, his mission picks up pace. He passes on his usual prey. There are better options where he's heading. Cahills Crossing. A road that only floods at the highest tides of the year. He's timed it perfectly. As the river rises, mullet traveling from the sea take their only chance to run the crossing and continue their journey upstream to their spawning grounds. And the crocs know it… making this possibly the greatest gathering of saltwater crocodiles on Earth. But the water's so churned up, he can't see the fish. So he splays his limbs and points his digits. His scales are covered in pressure sensors. By spreading out, he can more accurately detect the movement of his prey. Driven by instinct, the mullet won't turn back. These ancient predators have the most powerful bite in the animal kingdom. Then, just an hour after high tide… it's all over. He returns to his solitary life, the beneficiary of the park's protection and the rich bounty that comes from the seas beyond Kakadu. Australia's Great Barrier Reef. One and a half thousand miles of reef, atolls, and islands. The largest coral reef system in the world. Most of it protected as a marine park. Beneath the surface, an explosion of life and diversity. It's a busy underwater metropolis. Corals represent just 1% of the ocean, yet support nearly a quarter of all marine life. The Great Barrier Reef is so extraordinary… that even the smallest of places here has a huge role to play. Raine Island is just half a mile long. A tiny strip of sand in a vast ocean. The park is a lifeline for 90% of the region's endangered green sea turtles. Each summer, thousands of them travel huge distances across the Pacific to reach this tiny island… the largest green turtle nesting site in the world. Up to one million eggs are laid in the sand here every season. As they have been for a thousand years. But our world is changing fast. Today, the accelerating pace of climate change is having a devastating impact. The hatchling's sex is determined by the temperature inside its nest. Hotter sands now mean that up to 99% of eggs that hatch here are female. And there's more. As the planet warms and waters rise, nest sites can flood, drowning the eggs. With much of the beach just inches above sea level, Raine Island is at serious risk. It's been said that we're the first generation to feel the impact of global warming. And the last that can do something about it. Our parks, like the rest of the planet, are now threatened by extreme weather, escalating pollution, and biodiversity and habitat loss. Some of it, the result of the choices we all make in our daily lives. We risk our own well-being… and that of future generations. But we're not powerless. We can turn things around. If we act now. In some protected places, we already have. In the heart of Africa, Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park. After genocide tore the country apart, this tiny nation rebuilt. And as Rwanda healed, it prioritized conservation. The rich volcanic soil is farmed right up to a discreet stone wall. Beyond the boundary, one of the last two populations of endangered mountain gorillas. The family is making the most of the bamboo. There are nine females in this troop, including this mother with her newborn, the youngest gorilla in the whole park. Just three weeks old, she's barely able to raise her head. In a few months, she'll be given a name by the Rwandan government in a ceremony that celebrates the arrival of each new gorilla. She and her seven siblings are part of a baby boom which has seen mountain gorilla numbers double. While their father, Mirambo, grabs a little shut-eye, his three-year-old son, Paradiso, keeps a watchful eye over the family. He seems keen to impress Dad… …and has all the makings of a future leader. But he's gonna need some shaping. Volcanoes National Park is a gorilla's paradise, but it wasn't always this way. Just 40 years ago, poaching and habitat destruction were rife. But efforts to protect the gorillas mean that, today, Mirambo and his family are safe. Even when they do leave the sanctuary of their forest. They carefully cross the park wall. Others, too, leave the park in search of delicacies. Rare golden monkeys that live only in these mountains come to pocket potatoes. But wildlife isn't harmed. And neither do farmers lose out. Damaged crops are paid for, and revenue from wildlife tourism is reinvested in local communities. Meaning people can live sustainably with nature. And there are plans to increase the size of the park. Ensuring that by the time Paradiso reigns here, his future, and that of his species, is secure. Active conservation is responsible for protecting so many of the world's national parks and their inhabitants. In Yellowstone, that's included species that are fundamental to a nation's identity. Just over 100 years ago, American bison were facing extinction. Today, in the safety of the trees, a bison calf, just minutes old. Soon, she'll be strong enough to explore her world and meet her playmates. Some 5,000 bison now roam Yellowstone. A key attraction for the millions of visitors who come to the park each year. The feeling of seeing a bison for the first time is something I will never forget. It's here that, as a kid, I started to truly appreciate for the first time my place in nature. That I was part of something much bigger than myself. I wish everybody had the chance to visit a national park. To experience the sheer joy and wonder of nature. To understand that each one of us is part of this precious natural world. Each breath we take. Each glass of water we drink. So many of the medical and scientific discoveries we make. The fabric of wild space connects to our lives in so many ways. It's up to us to protect it, to care for it, and to pass on these wild spaces to the next generation. Join me as we explore the wonders and secrets of some of the most extraordinary national parks on the planet.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme

Oh, hey! It's me, Blippi. And did you see what I was just doing? Yeah! I was jumping. Whoo-hoo! And look at where I'm at today. Yeah! Today I'm at Sky Zone Indoor Trampoline Park in Anaheim, California. And there's a lot of trampolines in there. You know what you do on a trampoline? Yeah! You jump! Whoo-hoo! Let's go have some fun. Whoo-hoo! Hey! Hey, welcome to Sky Zone. I'm Quincy. Oh, nice to meet you! I'm Blippi. Yeah! How do we get started? So to get started today, we gotta pick from a rainbow of wristbands. Whoa! Cool! Look how colorful they are. Looks like we have some orange, yellow, blue, red, green, and pink wristbands. Um, can I do a blue wristband, please? Of course, Blippi. Hmm. Let's do that arm. That arm. Yeah. Thank you very much. You're very welcome. Oh, I'm so excited! What's next? What's next is you get to pick from any of these socks right here. Whoa! Cool! There are so many colorful socks back there. I wonder which ones he's gonna grab. I know your favorite color is blue and orange, so I had to get you the very special ones right here. Yeah! All right. We have some blue socks and some orange socks. Well, since I have a blue wristband, maybe I'll do some orange socks. Yeah? Is that okay? That's a great decision. All right. Am I ready? You're all ready. I'm gonna meet you up here in a minute and we're gonna go have some fun. All right, yeah! Let's go! Whoa! Did you see that? Wow! Quincy, that was awesome! I appreciate it, Blippi. Whoa! What is this place? Oh, this is our dunk course here. This is where we get to have all of our fun with the basketball. We get to dunk like we're Kobe and Michael. We get to have fun right here. Cool! That sounds like so much fun. Looks like there's a trampoline, and then there's a basketball hoop. And then you jump, and you dunk! Whoa! Can you teach us how to do it? Of course I can. So it's real simple. First off, you got to get a few jumps in. Okay. And then you gotta get a lot of air. And then, at the very last minute, you're gonna punch it through the rim. All right, let's check this out! Whoa! That was awesome! Yeah! Quincy, do you mind if I try? Go ahead, Blippi. All right, here we go. So I need to jump some, need to get some air, and then, I need to dunk. Here I go! Yeah! I made it! Whoo-hoo! That was awesome. It felt like I was just flying in the air. Whoa! All right! What do you do next? Well, Blippi, once you get good with it, you can put a little flair to it, a little flavor. Wow. All right, let's check it out. Oh! Whoa! Did you see that? He spun, and then put the ball under his legs, and then he dunked. Wow! All right. Think you can match? Um… I can probably do a trick, but maybe not that good. But I'll try! All right, here we go. Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo, I did it! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoa, cool! Looks like a rock wall. That indeed it is, Blippi. That indeed. Wow. What are we gonna do here? Well, we're gonna race each other to the top and hit these red buttons here. Oh. All right, how many times? Uh, I think we're gonna hit 'em two times today. Two times? Okay, so we have to go up, hit it, down, up, hit it, and then whoever lands first wins, right? Yes, sir. Right. Have you ever done this before? Uh, it's been a very long time, but I'm excited to do this. All right, me too, and I think I'm ready. Are you ready? All right. I'm ready. Let's go to our starting marks. 'Kay. Are you ready? I am. Are you? Yup! On your mark, get set, go! Yeah-- Oh, no! Oh, I fell down too! These walls are slippery today. Yeah! Whoa! Wow, good job! Oh, man. Looks like I won that one. But you were going really fast. So were you, Blippi. Thank you. That was tricky. Do you have any other competitions we can do? Oh, I got plenty for us. All right. Let's go! Let's go. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, check it out! I'm jumping on a trampoline. Whoo-hoo! Whoa! I love jumping on trampolines. Yeah, it's a great way to exercise, and have fun! Oh! Look! Wow! So many colorful balls. Wow! Check it out! Ooh, check out the colors. Looks like we have an orange ball, a red ball, a blue ball, a purple ball, a green ball, and a yellow ball. Ooh! And they're really soft and squishy. Whoa! How many balls do you see here? One, two, three, four, five, six. Wow! Six balls. What kind of balls are these? Wait a second. Soft, squishy balls, trampolines, and it looks like we're in an arena. Oh, yeah! This is a dodgeball arena. Wow! I love dodgeball! Oh! Blippi, I found you. Yeah! Yeah, I actually found the dodgeball arena. Oh, that you did. Yeah! Have you ever played dodgeball before? I'm a GOAT at dodgeball. Really? Wow! I'm a GOAT. Well, I'm actually not too bad myself. Do you wanna play dodgeball? Let's get into it, Blippi. All right! How you play dodgeball is you take these soft balls, throw 'em at your opponent… Whoa! If you hit them and they don't catch it, you get a point. But if they catch it, you have one point less than what you did. All right, are you ready? I'm ready. Okay, let's set 'em up. All right. Are you ready? I'm ready, you ready? I'm ready too. On your mark, get set, go! Whoa! Whoa! Yeah! That was awesome! No, we're done, we're done! Good job! That was awesome. Wow, you won! I did? You did so good. Yeah! You totally beat me. I did? Yeah, you're really good. Whew! Wow. Do you have any other fun games we can compete together with? I got plenty for you, Blippi. I got plenty. All right, let's go! Let's go. Whoa! It looks like an obstacle course. It most definitely is, Blippi. Wow, are you good at obstacle courses? I'm pretty good at obstacle courses. Are you? I'm pretty good. Wow! I am pretty fast. How do you do this one? This one starts off really simple. You just bound across these half-circles right here, and then you're gonna go all the way to the end, loop back, and finish right back here. Wow! So it's like a race. And I think I'm ready. Are you ready? I'm pretty ready, are you? I'm ready! You should start, all right? Yeah, I'll start. All right. 'Kay, on your marks, get set, go! Come on, Quincy, you got it! You got it, come on! A little faster! Faster! Faster! Whoa! Nice swing! Whoa! Yeah! He's really fast. Whoa! Whoa! He's gonna be tough to beat. Yeah, Quincy, yeah! Wow! That was really fast. Good job! Oh, thank you, Blippi. Wow, was it hard? It was a little hard, but I think you got it. All right, I'm ready. Is it my turn? Yes, sir, it is. All right. You wanna start me? I got you. On your marks, get set, go! Whoa! Ooh! Okay, Blippi. I see you. I see you, Mr. Blippi. Whoa! Real strong out there, Blippi. Good work. Come on, Blippi, let's go. Let's go, Blippi! Oh, he's gonna beat me, man. He's-- He's gonna have me beat. Come on, Blippi. Keep it going, man. Ooh. Whoo, come on, Blippi. Let's go, Blippi. Come on, Blippi. Yeah! I feel like I did pretty fast. You went pretty fast, Blippi. And? Oh! I won! Congratulations, Blippi. Wow, you did so good too, though. I appreciate it, man. That was a close one. Wow. It was really close there at the end. And thank you so much for competing with me. It was a very friendly competition today. Of course. It's been my pleasure competing with you. It's always good to have somebody that can compete with me. Yeah! Well, it was very nice meeting you. Nice to meet you too, Blippi. But I gotta get back to work now. All right, see you later! See you, man. Bye-bye! Wow! That was so much fun competing with him. He did so good today. Yeah. And the most important thing, though, was we had fun! Well, I should probably get some water. I'm very thirsty. It's important to hydrate! Whoa! Perfect. Yeah! Hydrating after exercise is very important. It's very hot right now, but when I drink this water, it'll help me cool back down. Mmm. And it's very tasty. Wow! What a fun day that was. It's very healthy to exercise! And competing was awesome. I love competing. And it's okay to lose. Yeah! I even lost today, remember? The cool thing about losing is it just makes you wanna get better and better. And when you compete, it'll make you better! Practice makes you better. All right, shall we have some more fun? Yeah!

Grandpa, you know they have apps for this, right? Oh yeah, why don't we stare at an app instead of the natural beauty and vastness of the night sky, bathed in stars hung in space? Just saying. Yeah, well, I'm just saying sometimes it's good to learn to do things for yourself. Look, we have a new moon and clear skies. Alright, I'm just gonna rotate the telescope three degrees west, okay? Did you write it down? You know what? Let me know if there's a black hole, an explosion, anything cool. Alright. Whoa. What's that? Hey! Whoa! Hey. Huh? Was that cool enough for you? Alright. Come on. We've got to get in and out of here, fast. We have to evacuate within 30 minutes. You really think there's something inside? We're about to find out. This is incredible. Sh. What are you doing? Put that thing away. I'm taking a photo. No. Put it away. Who's there? Oops. Forgot the flash. Stay where you are. Rocco, go. Go. Let's go. Go. Go! Let's go! Come on, Grandpa. I'm coming. Where are they? Over here. Hurry. I'm climbing the walls in here. Literally. I say we bust out of this joint so I can run laps around this place. You're sure this escape plan is gonna work, Zeta? I don't about \"practically foolproof.\" Might be a wee bit optimistic. We understand, Zeta. I'd be dying to get home too, if I was lucky enough to have a family. I mean, what do we gotta lose anyway? It's the same old grub, twice a day. The chef has zero imagination. Or taste buds. He's coming. Lads, we have no more time for thinking. Let's do this. Sh. Everybody hold still. I am now entering Zeta's enclosure. It's showtime. Time to razzle-dazzle. What are you doing? A quick snack for the road. I'm gonna need my strength, right? Mm. Cover me, lass. Gotcha. I feel the need to sneeze. Hey! Get off me! What? My suit's been compromised! Go on, get down there. Otis, stop eating. You're on. Come on, just one more bite. Get the door now. Okay. Z, come on. We can't hesitate. Quick. Follow me. I can't see a blooming thing in this fog. Guys, I think we lost him. Where are Z and Haggis? Try to keep up. I'm a lean, mean, speed machine. I'm a terrier. I wasn't built for long distance. Otis, you better hold that door. It's our only way out of here. Hang on, gang. I've got your back. Stellar save, Otis. More guards. You better run now. Come on, Grandpa. You're gonna be late. Yeah. First… First day of summer classes. Let's get to it. Come on, come on, come on. Now, we need at least ten students for this course to stay open in the fall, so if anyone asks, you're 19. I wish you still worked at the observatory. It's not fair-- It's not that bad. I mean, look, I still have all these students here, eager to learn. You see one little UFO, you write one little book about UFOs, and everyone writes you off as a weirdo. And me by association. One day, I'm gonna prove to everyone what we saw was real. Look, Andre, not everyone can believe in something they haven't experienced for themselves. Alright? I don't want you sneaking around the observatory anymore. I want you to just focus on being a normal kid this summer. Well, and on being my tenth student. Alright, wish me luck. Good luck. Looks like you'll need it. Good morning, everyone. I'm Professor Dennis Johnson. Welcome to the first day of Astronomy 101. Uh… I thought this was Astrology 101. You know, like, my signs and stuff. Uh, no. No. This is the real science of celestial objects. For example, the difference between a meteor and a meteorite. Any thoughts? Any ideas, anyone? Anyone at all, don't be shy. Uh, okay. A meteor is a piece of matter that enters our atmosphere. A meteorite is if it actually makes it all the way down without burning up. Precisely. Great job. I love your enthusiasm… young man. Your textbook is garbage. Text who? So, instead, we'll all be reading my book on Lost Harbor's unexplained astronomical phenomena. Alright, let's hand these out. I think we're lost. Yeah, we're definitely lost. Whatever you're doing back there, lass, you better hurry up. We don't have all day. Give her a second. Z senses an energy source. That's right, Z. We should definitely keep moving. This way. Guys, incoming bogeys. Quick, hide. What do you mean, you can't find them? Let's check the tunnel. That was way too close for comfort. Haggis? We gotta get moving. I'm getting twitchy. Which way? Sh! Chillax, bro. Haggis is doing his trance thing. Just let him vibe. I got it. Follow me, pack! It's this way. Dang! It's trippy how he does that. Don't worry, Zeta. They're gone now. What's going on? All systems are down. All of them? Mm-hm. I'm done, lads. I'm totally knackered. Are you kidding? I barely broke a pant. Haggis, where to now? Think, Haggis, think! I don't know, guys. I've never been here before. It's a hard yin. Oh, we gotta get out of here. I can't go back in that room. Easy, Champ. Breathe, buddy. Breathe. Find your inner calm. I'm calm. What makes you think I'm not calm? Yeah. You're as calm as a cloud. Oops. My bad. Okay. That's awesome. What's the plan now? Intruder alert. They're outside the door. Let's pop this can. We'd better find a place to hide, like, yesterday. This way. Guys, come on. Here's Rocco! Come on! Okay, lads. Tuck in your tails. Spread out! Oh no. We're trapped! Yeah, I don't like the situation either, Z. Come on out. You little monster. I got a treat for you. What are we gonna do now? I don't know. I'm not the idea guy. Haggis? I think we're done for, lads. That's not the positive attitude I was looking for. No, Z. It's not your fault. We're a pack. All in this together. Now, be quiet. Ah… Ah… Ah… Huh? Oopsie. Allergies. You heard the lass. We don't have a choice. Best make a run for it. I'll create a diversion. So much for that bonnie idea. Alright, everybody, split up. It's our best chance. On the count of three. Two! Three! Let's go! Leave them! Leave them! We got what we need. I got you now. Got it, boss. Oh… Another escape attempt, huh, Zeta? With friends this time. Very, very clever. You certainly do keep us on our toes. At least now we know why you wanted those puppies, hm? Oh… Speaking of which, Rocco, where are its accomplices? Who cares? We'll just get some new ones at the pound. Solid pitch, Rocco. Really solid. Mm? Mm. Why don't we put a pin in that one? Here's another idea. Don't let those dogs escape! New priority: don't let those puppies escape. You heard Fisk. Let's go. Woohoo! Freedom to run. Boom! That was weird. Booyah! Whoa. I feel all tingly. Oh no! He's right on my tail, I can't shake him! Okay, Luna. Stay calm. Center yourself. Let your senses guide you. Hm. What's this? Smells delicious. Mom, are we done yet? I want to go to the beach with my friends. Sorry Emma, honey. I'm gonna need your help all day. I can't outrun these numpties. I need a plan. Think, Haggis, think. That's it! Use your advantages. Hey, get him! This wee body was built for tunnels. Oh, the rat pack warned me they'd send you. Don't eat me! I'm practically skin and bones! Make it quick! I can't handle the torture! Quit the drama, Shakespeare. I'm not here for you. I'm on the run myself. Oh. Phew. Oh, thank goodness. I'll make you a deal. You show me the way out of this maze and I'll let you go scot-free. Uh, in that case… Follow me. Don't look back, Otis. Keep charging. Why'd you leave me so broken-hearted Baby, it's… Just breathe. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Hey, little buddy. Thank goodness. My daughter would have never talked to me again. What… What have you been eating? Remember, I was never here, and you didn't see me. Do I make myself clear? Come on. Do I look like a dirty rat to you? Oh. Hammer down, hammer down I'm gonna bring the hammer down… It's not the time to be picky, Haggis. Yeah, yeah I say yeah… Just my luck. A tone-deaf bampa that screeches like a wounded parakeet. …down! Hammer down, hammer down Hammer down Otis. Hm. You know what? I think my daughter would be perfect for you. Ew! What the… What is this? Who's that staring at me? Oh. That's just me. Gross. It's like salty toilet water. Anyway, I think we lost 'em, gang. Gang? Gang? Amigos? Homefries? Ah, dang 'er. Now where did those guys go? Oh no. They found me. I got nowhere to run. There you are. Dude, it's alright. I won't hurt you. Hm, you look pretty friendly. What's your name? Champ. Well, Champ, we better go before those goons chasing you arrive. Come on. This is it. I'm going to smell like fried fish for the rest of my life. Couldn't just make it a smoothie truck, it had to be fish. Whoa. This is destiny. My favorite fragrance. Lavender. Everyone else is at the beach. You can go to the beach with your friends. Hey, you're kinda cute. In a sad, wrinkly kinda way. Oh no. The scent is too strong. It's tick-- Tickling my nose. Ew! Ew. Not my best first impression. Luna? Okay, Luna. Come on. You can stay with me for one night until we find your family. Hey, man. Wanna put that on your tab? Solid pick though. What would Jerry say? Uh, I don't know, I mean… He's gone, so can't be sure. Maybe something like, \"Yeah, go ahead and enjoy being a kid.\" I know. You can work this off babysitting your sister. Oh, and I just restocked the baby powder, so don't be shy when you change her. Good luck, JJ. If you love me, Bree, you'll hold it in. Who gave that walloper a license? I nearly boked back there. Great. Now this thing's busted, too. Well… It looks like Zeta taught our puppies a few tricks after all. They have tracking chips inside. How hard could it be? Yeah, well, those don't seem to be working too hot right now. Besides, they're just dogs. Correction, Rocco. They were just dogs, hm? Yeah. Okay. I got it, boss. I'll find them. Hammer down, hammer down Wait right here. Uh, by any chance, do you have food? I'm starving. No cell phones while driving, Rocco. Please, Sheriff, a little professional courtesy here, huh? I'm on the job. Just like you. Nice. Did you make that yourself? Come on, Sheriff. Respect the badge. Thanks for the ride. I left a jobby in the back for you as a tip. …difference between me and a real cop like you is one silly… Aye, that looks like just the place to hide out. …private law enforcement… We're just two sides of the same coin, compadre. Bump it. Come on. Bump it. You're lucky I'm in a good mood. Where's Riot's treat? Intruder alert! You better mind your Ps and Qs or I'll feed you to the cats. Aye. What do you know? Looks like I'm just in time for supper. Hello, ma'am. Hi. How are you today? Now, I'm going to have to ask you politely to stand back from that scran. Bree, Bree, if you keep quiet, I'll let you see the puppies. Puppies. Deal? Let that be a lesson to you all. From now on, I run this pen. Back again? What can I say, man? She loves to see the puppies. That's my ticket out of here. No, we can't take one home. No. Look, you realize this is a place of business. Show me the money! Not some kind of petting zoo. Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do, tough guy? Doggie. Sh. Pipe down, lass, or you'll give us away. Oh, I don't know. What do you think we should do about it, Riot? Hasta la vista, baby! This is no way to run a business. I'm a future paying customer. Come on, Bree. Let's go. You just found him, uh, wandering around in the woods, huh? And the tag had no owners on it? No phone number? Nothing? I think he's a stray. Yeah. Well you know, stranger things have happened. So… Welcome home here, Champ. He's a pretty frisky guy, isn't he? Here, tell you what. Let me see if he can fetch this one. Look… You can keep him, but I am not cleaning up any of his-- Oh. Wow. I have never seen a dog move that fast. Happy birthday Tor-Tor! Happy birthday to Tor-Tor Oh my goodness! Yeah, I mean, I know it's next week, but I figured, why not? You got me a puppy? Yeah. Hey, his name is Otis, and I think he's gonna be your boffle. It's not boffle, is it? Is it boffle? Uh… Sort of. It's Best Friends For Life. Eh, anyways. I love him. You're okay. Well, he's all yours. No, Otis! Otis! Come here, Otis! Oh, no, no, no! Oh! Love you! Maybe he can wait in your room during dinner, sweetie? Oh! Evening, Evelyn. Thank you for consulting with me first about the puppy. It's her birthday. Great. Max. Hi. Sheriff. I'm gonna go. Mm-hm. Come on. This is inhumane. First I get sneezed on, and now I have to listen to you snore. All night. What's this… sucking toy called? It's so relaxing. I've never felt more calm. Otis? Is that you? Otis. It's just a midnight snack. Dig in. I can share. You are lucky you're so cute. Let's get going already. I gotta go find my pack. Yes, yes. Okay. Alright, let's go. Okay. You wanna run? Okay, let's go. Come on. Come on, Champ. Great. It was just a nightmare. Ew. What the heck is this? It… looks like a puppy. Look, Bree… I took her to the pet store. She wanted to see the puppies-- Come on. Your baby sister brought home a dog? No, I don't think so. You brought him home, so you get to take care of him. That, or I'm sending you to that Tibetan monastery we talked about. You know, the one where they only eat rice and there's no Pizza Pops. Meditate on that, my friend. Wait a tick… Unclaimed territory! I claim this land for the glory of Haggis. No, no, no! No! And I claim this land. You could get yourself shocked, whizzing on an electric guitar. Ow! Jeez. No touching the merchandise, grabby-hands. I'll be back later, lass. Oh, but remember, I've got first dibs on that soother thing. Alright, enough messing around. Time to go find my mates. Bye-bye. Oh, sick. Problem solved. No. No. I was only kidding. I-I was just kidding. Yeah. It's gonna be fine, and I'm gonna get him back. Yeah. Yeah, just kidding. Okay, we may as well use that crazy energy of yours, Champ. Alright. Challenge accepted. Ready? Okay. And… giddy up! Hang on tight. This is gonna be the ride of your life. Whoa! I'm off to the beach, Mom! Whoa! Hey, Champ! There you are! Champ, slow down! Wait, I know that dog! You'll like the vet, Otis. It'll be fun! You'll meet tons of new friends. Haggis, wait up! Hey, man. Not a chance. Just try to keep up. Whoa. Otis! Go on. Wait! Wait up! There you are, you big galoot! Haggis, you ol' grumpus! Alright. Alright, Otis. Get it out of your system, lad. Okay, okay, enough roughhousing. I was so worried about you. Uh, is that your human? Yeah, unfortunately. Slim pickings. Whoa! Okay, Champ. Let's turn around. Whoa! Guys! I found you! I seem to be stuck. I'll pull harder. Oops, my bad. Um… Can I help you? I've never swallowed so many bugs in my life. Slow down. Got ya! I'd know those scents anywhere. Do you wanna go to the vet? You're one strange little pup. Maybe they can give you an allergy pill. Luna! Finally. About time you showed up. It's like they're already best friends or something. I would have appreciated a pee trail, but once I locked onto your scents, it was easy-peasy. Aw. A little belly-scratching goes a long way. She's all better. No cat-astrophe. So sweet. Yeah, to you. Bye, Sophie. Thank you, Dr. Connors. Tori, are these all your friends? Actually, we just met. Four patients in one day. It's, uh… It's an e-paw-demic. Get it? I get it. 'Cause of the puppies. No? Crickets. So, what are we here for today? Well, as long as I'm here, is it normal for a puppy to sneeze all the time with tons of mucus? It's normal for a bloodhound. It helps with their exceptional ability to smell and track. Well, I'm pretty sure if hyper-pup here stays still for 30 seconds, he'll implode. German Shorthaired Pointers are known for having an abundance of kinetic energy. Otis eats literally everything. And he won't stop growing. Show me a Bernese who doesn't. Technically, he brought me here. He's like Houdini but with serious personality quirks. Terriers are very intelligent, but very cantankerous. It's better safe than sorry. Come on back. Hey, bud. Luna's olfactory bulb is seriously overdeveloped. A normal dog? Thirty times a human's size. Luna's? A hundred and twenty. Is that bad? Her sense of smell must be off the charts. I've never seen anything like it. I've never known an animal to produce this much mucus. Well, maybe the magnum snail. Wait… What's this? What's that? Wow. Talk about a sinus cleansing. What is that? That? That shouldn't be there. Incredible. This can't be right. I knew it. What's wrong with the little pee cannon? No wonder he's drinking so much water. He's burning up. Aye. This is a bonnie cap. His electromagnetic neurons are firing at an abnormally fast rate. This dog might actually be… Well… Definitely is smarter than you. No offense. Offense taken. Just watch. Whoa. Now this I like. Twenty more miles of this and I'll be ready for breakfast. And that's what we would call in the medical game, abnormal. And that's what we would call impossible. 520 beats per minute. His heart's beating like a hummingbird. Okay. There's a good boy. What? A Bernese this age should be 35 pounds max. Oh, my goodness. Whoa. Oh, my… Weight, bone density, growth rate, all totally off the charts. He's as strong as a bull. Hm. You see? Each pup's normal characteristics are way, way off the charts. I mean, way off from normal. Yet aside from that, they all seem perfectly healthy. I don't get it. It's like they're, it's like they're some kind of… Super pups. Okay, so, what do we do with these puppies now? I'll tell you what we do. We bust into the observatory, we expose what those government kooks are doing up there. Creating freaky super pups. Come on, guys, who's with me? Yeah, count me out. Look, you and your grandpa already have weirdo status in this town, and you got nothing to lose. I'd like to have a fun summer. Yeah, I got my own problems. If I don't get this little runt home to my sister soon, I get a one-way ticket to a Tibetan monastery. We gotta get Z out of there. No pup left behind, remember? We're a pack. Our own family. We protect each other, no matter what. I know. Let's storm the fortress. Not so fast, impulsive one. I'm working on a plan. I have a scheme cooking. Hang on, Z. We're coming for you. Welcome back, Zeta. Home sweet home. You better get used to it. So… You thought your little friends could help you? What did you do with those puppies?","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-G","Word Count":3403,"Year Published":2022,"Season &

Yip, get down from there. Are there any other pilots you could call? I'm looking after two pups today. Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can. Spike? Are you home? Hi, Mom. I think Spike went to the moon today. Or maybe it was the mall. Great. I have to make an emergency blimp delivery, but I need somebody to take Yip and Cousin Rhonda to the playground. I can do it. Where's Cheddar Biscuit? At circus camp. I can do it. Where are-- Gilber's at a stamp-collecting meeting, Paw's at work, and Grandma and Grandpaw are in the garage, but I can do it. Tag, taking care of puppies is a lot of responsibility. Plus, these two pups are an awful pawful. It's a job for a big dog. I am a big dog. I scoop my own kibble, I clean my own bowl, I wash my own collar, and I drive my own scooter, which I built. Hmm. Maybe you are ready for a big dog job. All right. Take this and these. I just need you to get them to the playground. I'll meet you there as soon as I'm done. I'm on it. Be safe. Be alert. And don't let them out of your-- Wait, where did they go? Right here. I've got this, Mom. Get back here, Yip! Drop it, Rhonda! How nice to see three puppies playing in the garage. Two puppies, Grandpaw. And one big dog. That's me. So, no playing. I've gotta get these pups to the park. Wow. All by yourself? I'm impressed. Yeah. It's no big deal for a big d-- A little advice about taking care of puppies. Never blink. Got it, Grandma. No blinking. Oops! No more blinking. No more blinking. That was my last blink. Go, Big Dog, Go! You think she can handle it? I know I couldn't. I'm tired just watching them. Playground, here we come! You all right back there, Yip? How about you, Rhonda? That sounds like a yes and a yes! Well, I'll get you there in two wags of a tail. Wait, I can't go fast. I need to drive nice and slow. Like a big dog. Ooh, how about some music? Ooh, not that music. Oh, I love this song. I mean, I used to. When I was a puppy. Yep, that's Paw's doorbell store. But we're not going there, we're going to the playground. Just as soon as I make a nice, responsible stop. I am nailing this. Hello. Hello! Do you like my hat? And wanna play some baseball? No time for playing, Lady Lydia. I've gotta get these pups to the park. Goodbye. Goodbye. No, I was saying goodbye to the puppies, because they're running away. Ahh! Wait for me! Goodbye! That one was for you. Puppies! Puppies? There you pups are. Tag, they remind me of when you were a puppy. You loved ringing the doorbells. Go ahead, ring one. For old times' sake. Okay! No. I'm not a puppy anymore, Paw. Mm. Plus, I've got some pups to catch. Paw's got you. Want some help with these two? No, thanks. I've got it all under control. I just need a way to keep them from running off. Well, as I always say, there's a doorbell for every problem. No. No, that-- that's not gonna work. Hmm, not it. You like that one? See? There's a doorbell for every problem. Huh. I do always say that. Sometimes, twice a day. [barking along to \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\"] Lamb doorbell, not... bad. Get it, kids? Bad? 'Cause it's a lamb? I'm hilarious! Let's see how we're doin'. The park is up ahead. Everything is going great. Could go greater with balloons. Ooh, I do love balloons. No. No balloons for me. I'm not a puppy. But they are. Have fun back there, pups. Ol' Tag will get you to the park in no time. Heya, Tag. Hi, Manhole Dog. What you up to? Eh, not much. Just watchin' some flying puppies. Huh, that sounds nice. Wait, flying puppies? Flying puppies! I have to get up there. It's a good thing they're heading towards the Town Ladder. Huh. I forgot we had a Town Ladder. Thanks, Manhole Dog. Nice chattin' with you, Tag. I'm coming, pups. Gotcha. Oh, oh! Ah! Mom! Oh, I can't let her see us. Hide, pups. Hide! Balloons. That's pretty. Phew! Close one. Hey, there's the park! Prepare for landing. Now, how do we get down? Hey, Green Birds. A little help, please? Whoo-hoo! Not yet. Not yet. Okay, now! Thanks, guys! Yes! Playground up ahead. Come on, grab my paws, and don't let go. Nothing is gonna stop us now. Excuse me? I'm looking for the tennis courts. You know where they are? Yep, that way. Oh, no! Tennis balls! Yip! Rhonda! Sit! Stay! Roll over! I can't get them to the playground. Maybe I'm not such a big dog after all. Oh! Look at 'em bounce! Manhole Dog, do you like my bat? Yeah, it goes nicely with your hat. And it's perfect for chasing tennis balls. Let's play. Ooh, nice catch! I got it! Whoa! Big dogs chasing tennis balls? I guess big dogs can play. Well, if they can play, so can I. Time to out-puppy the puppies. Oh, Yip and Rhonda... To the playground. Then, you can run around as much as you want. Hi, Ma! Hi, Tag. Wow! Good job getting those puppies to the playground. It was no big deal. I guess you're a big dog after all. But I've still got some puppy in me! Yeah. Me, too. Huh? \"The Case of the Slobbery.\" Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Scooch, why do we keep saying, \"Hmm?\" Because that's what the famous detective, Go-tective Snout, does when she finds a clue. And I just spotted another clue to the mystery of who had the melting ice cream cone. Hmm. Hmm. A-ha! Manhole Dog, it was you! It was me, I admit it, I did it. Wait, what did I do? Your ice cream cone melted. It's no big deal. Oh, what a relief. And that's the problem, Scooch. It's no big deal. But you said we'd find a big mystery. Maybe they know of one. Oh. Hi, Grandma and Grandpaw. We're looking for a big mystery. Know of anything? Sorry, Tag, off to do a repair job. Have fun! Hmm... Sorry, Scooch. I think this detective thing is too slow for me. Can we play something else? Sure, Tag. And we don't need to bother with the cool helmets and the walkie-talkies and the exciting chases. Exactly, so let's-- Wait, what? That's what makes Go-tective Snout a Go-tective. She buzzes around town in her Go-tective Mobile, solving Go-tective cases... Go-tectively. I guess we won't be needing these. Scooch! Why didn't you mention all this exciting Go stuff before? Come in, Go-tective Scooch, this is Go-tective Tag. Don't forget to say, \"Over.\" Over what? Go-tective Snout says \"over\" when she's done talking through a walkie. Oh! Got it. I-I mean, got it. Over. Now, we just need a big case to solve. In our Go-tective mobile! That'll work. Go, Go-tectives, go! Come in, Go-tective Scooch. Can you hear me? I repeat, can you hear me? Over. Um, I'm right next to you. I know, but it's more Go-tective-y when we speak through the radio. Any sign of a big case? Over. No, but as Go-tective Snout always says, \"A good detective keeps their ears up and their eyes wide open.\" How long do we have to do this? Until we find a big case, I guess. Hey, Tag. Did you hear the Rover Coaster is missing? Total bummer. Missing Rover Coaster? Scooch! That's the best ride at the Amusement Bark! So? So, this could be our big case to solve. Oh, yeah. Well, as Go-tective Snout always says, \"Let's sniff it out.\" Eyes open, ears up, and nose sniffing. Wait a minute, the Rover Coaster is right there. Hmm. The tracks are here, but the cars are missing. There's supposed to be a big bone car on the tracks, but it's gone! Go-tective Scooch, it's a robbery. I don't know, Tag. Just because the coaster is missing doesn't mean someone stole it. Scooch, I've been a detective for ten minutes. I think I know a robbery when I see one. First step, look for pawprints. They're everywhere! 'Cause there's a lot of dogs here. But wait. Dog slobber! Must be from the robber! Which means it's not just a robbery. It's a slobbery! The Coaster! Go-tective Scooch, follow that coaster. Over. I agree. Over! We lost it. But look! More slobber. Right next to... Frank and Beans! I like saying our names. Spill the beans, Beans, and be frank with me, Frank. You two are the slobber robbers! What? First of all, we never slobber. Fine, we slobber. But we definitely didn't rob anything. Yeah! Oh, yeah? Well, I think you're hiding the Rover Coaster under that blanket. Tag, it seems a little small for-- A-ha! A teddy bear? Purply Bear! A new friend for Pinkie Bear. Frank won him for me in that Tail Toss game. Shh! Sweet dreams, Purply Bear, Prince of Purpleness. Come on, Scooch, the Rover Coaster can't be far. The Rover Coaster? Oh, yeah, I just saw it go down Waggy Way. Go-tective Scooch, we're headed to Waggy Way. Over. Thank you, gentlemen. Aw. Can't sleep, Purply Bear? Do what I do. Count sheepdogs. One... I don't see the coaster. Go-tective Scooch, activating bone-oculars. Coaster spotted. Heading north into the Hedge Maze. And we're gonna crash right into it! You're looking through the bone-oculars. Oh! Right. I knew that. Hold on tight! Oops, that was the wrong way. Never mind. It was the right way. Whoa! Here we go! Ah! Yah! Just kidding! Now, we're almost there! Whoa! Whoa! As Go-tective Snout always says, \"You gotta have the stomach for detective work.\" But Tag, look! Slobber! Shh... A-ha! Lady Lydia? What are you doing? Watering the hedge. Do you like my hat? No. Because it means this is water, and not slobber. Uh, me? Slobber? Oh! I would never! Sorry for the trouble, ma'am. Just trying to track down the Rover Coaster. Rover Coaster? I saw it heading toward Ruff Ruff Road. Uh, Lady Lydia, you're watering Scooch. Oh! Oh, oh! I'm terribly sorry. That's okay. Thanks, Lady Lydia! Goodbye! Scooch, we keep hitting dead ends. This is the hardest case I've ever had to solve. Tag, it's the only case you've ever had to solve. Yeah, and it's a tough one. Tag, stop! Look! More slobber! Quick! Bury the bone! Bone? The Rover Coaster is shaped like a bone. Slobber, giant hole. The slobber robber is burying the Rover Coaster in this hole! Who's down there? Hello! Little Dog? Hey. What's up? And Big Dog? How could you? Dig up the bone! We... Would... Love to! Wait. That's not a giant bone. 'Cause I'm a little dog. She likes little bones. Then why the big hole? 'Cause I'm a big dog. He likes big holes. Well, I guess that isn't slobber on the grass. Then what is it? Ah, paw sweat. Makes sense. Go-tective Scooch, this is Go-tective Tag. We may never find that Rover Coaster. Over and out. Um, Tag? Never mind! We gotta go. Thanks, Little Dog. Thanks, Big Dog! They found our bone. We gotta bury it again. Yep, where they'll never find it. We're not letting it get away this time. Go-tective Scooch! The slobber robber's in the garage? Now what? Well, what would Go-tective Snout do? She'd probably rub her chin and say, \"Hmm\" a lot until she had an idea. Worth a shot. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I'm getting nothing. So, what would she do next? She'd chase this place. Ooh, I was hoping you'd say that. Go, Go-tectives, Go! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Oh, my hat! It's heading straight for the Amusement Bark! Back to the scene of the slobbery? Fascinating! We've done it, Go-tective Scooch. We've cornered the culprits. Grandma and Grandpaw? Oh, hi, there, Tag, Scooch. You... you stole the Rover Coaster? Stole it? Uh, we brought it to the garage to fix it. That's the repair job we told you about. Oh! Yeah. That checks out. But why all the slobber? Nachos. They always make your Grandpaw slobber. They do not! Well, slobbery solved, because there was no slobbery. Just slobber. And the Rover Coaster's back. Wanna go for a ride? Hmm. Hmm. Are you saying, \"Hmm\" because you're a Go-tective, or are you stalling because you're nervous? Little of both. Go-tective Scooch, I think there's only one thing left to do. Yep. Ride the Rover.

O-dokuro, legendary Yokai, one of the many fearsome Yokai that stalked the world long ago. Yeep yeep. Huh? Yeah, Spot, it is awesome. And that noble samurai, that Yokai-killing warrior, was my ancestor, Miyamoto Usagi! Miyamoto's sword, Willow Branch, was like lightning. Yeep yeep! Ikuzo! Again and again, he struck the dreaded Yokai with fierce blows. Hah! Hyah! Huh? It's okay, Spot, don't worry. It's just Auntie's farmbotto. It's not even turned on. See? Oh no! Whoops! Ikuzo! Someone get a picture! Oh no. No! Eep! Eep! No, no, no! Spot, move! Eep! Oh no, no, no, not the house! No, no, no! Whoa! Whoa! Huh? Not the watermelons! Yeep, yeep! Okay. I'm okay. What? I'm not okay. Do I even want to know what's going on here? It was an accident, but I saved the watermelons. Oh! Unbelievable. You could have been hurt. Does this sign mean nothing to you? It means \"no fighting the farmbotto.\" But he started it! You're turning 16 tomorrow. Act your age. Look at this thing. It's going to take all day to get it working again. I'm sorry, Auntie. I was just-- I know. You were dreaming of being a samurai. And, of course you're sorry. You're always sorry, and you always do it again. You can't just do the first thing that comes into your head. You need to start thinking before you act. Look at all this! Weeks of work ruined. That's half our broccoli crop. And you could have killed somebody! Fine! So obviously I can't do anything right! I mean, why am I even here? I'm turning 16! I should go to-- No. You don't talk now. Just please fix that farmbotto. Mm… I'll never be a samurai if I stay here. This has happened too many times. She'll be better off without me. I won't be around to mess up the crops. And in the city, I can become a samurai like my ancestor. I'll show everyone. I've got moves like they've never seen! Oof! Auntie! Hi. I've made up my mind. I'm going to Neo Edo, and you can't stop me. Whoa! Let's just relax. You're madder than I thought. You're right. I can't stop you. Edgewing! But it's your sword. Go on, take it. You'll need it if you're going to find a sensei in Neo Edo. Your great-grandfather and I made this sword ourselves back when I was your age. And that crystal-- It's called the Omurasaki. It belonged to Miyamoto Usagi. That crystal has been handed down from generation to generation. I set it in the sword's hilt myself. It has always brought me luck. Well, almost always. I love you and I promised your parents I would keep you safe. But I have to admit that you and this farm are not a good fit. This place is killing your soul. Goodbye, Spot. Mm. Take good care of him. Thank you, Auntie. And when you get to Neo Edo, find someone to teach you the way of the sword. A sensei. I don't need a sensei. I'm already the best. You've been training me for years! You need more. You need to learn respect, patience, and wisdom. Only then can you become what you are meant to be. A samurai. Promise me you will find yourself a true sensei. And that you'll be responsible with that sword. The greatest master needs their sword the least. Of course, you're right, Auntie. I'll find a sensei. And I promise I'll be so responsible with Edgewing. Who needs a sensei? I'm already an amazing swordsman. I'm going to the city to be the greatest samurai ever. Mm! Whee. Oh! Neo Edo. We made it, Spot. Yeep, yeep, yeep! Neo Edo! I can't wait to show them what I can do. Whoa! Whoa! I guess the Steamcycle is excited to be in Neo Edo too! I think it's picking up power from the Ki-Stone! Aw. What is bothering my sweet little Ki-Stone today? Are we all tuckered out from powering the whole city? Breaking news! I've heard of these things. It's a newsbotto. The criminal Warimashi has escaped custody! Reward for his capture is 100,000 joules. Maybe I'll fight that Warimashi. The criminal Warima-- Okay, Neo Edo, bring on the bad guys! \"Ha! You think yourself a great samurai?\" \"We will cut you down like a farmbotto harvesting broccoli.\" \"Your farm metaphors mean nothing to me.\" \"It's time to fight.\" \"Ikuzo!\" Ya! Usagi is victorious! And just as it seems things can't get any better for the mighty samurai, he receives the power of the Ki-Stone. To fight Yokai! O-Dokuro, the Skeleton Yokai! Karasu-tengu, Crow Yokai, master of martial arts! Tsuchi-gumo, the Spider Yokai! \"I am the ultimate Yokai fighter!\" Ya! Whoa! Okay, maybe we'd be better off on foot, Spot. I'll come back for ya! Evening. Look at the airship, Spot! You're gonna miss it! Yeep! Huh. These fancy city robotto don't even work. Hmm? Okay, what's going on? Do I smell? Been worse. Come on, I've been in town for half an hour and I haven't had a chance to use my new sword once. Please sir, you don't wanna hurt me. Not really, no, but it's time for lunch and food tastes better after I hit someone. Suddenly, the brave samurai, Usagi, comes upon a helpless pig at the mercy of a big, ugly brute of a rhino. What? \"Big ugly brute\"? Well, I mean, look at you. The name is Gen. And your description is accurate, but still offensive. I'm sorry, I did not mean to say that out loud. Now, put down the pig or I'll put down the hurt. Wait, I-I can do better than that. Let go of the pig or I'll let loose on… N-no, no. That's even worse. Huh. First time I ever met a rabbit. Too bad I gotta smash it. What the heck? Thank you for your kindness. You can't threaten innocent pigs on my watch! I mean, not specifically… pigs. When I think about it, really any kind of-- I'm a bounty hunter, bunny! You just helped Neo Edo's most wanted criminal escape! That was Warimashi! I've been tracking him for weeks. Wait, wait. That was Warimashi? But-- but he looked so cute! And you look like a stuffed toy, but you're about to look like a pancake! Okay, hey, let's talk about this. I really am sorry. I-I-I thought you were the criminal. I want to be a samurai, and samurai are supposed to protect the innocent, so-- Assess the situation and get the facts before you engage. One of the first rules of fighting. Didn't your sensei teach you anything? I don't need a sensei! Says the guy who just let Warimashi escape! Ha! Ooh. Yokai! Hey, my puppet! Let him go! Tell him to let go of me. I'm trying… Cut it out! Hey, that rabbit ruined my big payday! That rabbit ruined my show! Come on. Sorry! My bad! Hey, that's my purse! And my wallet! That fox is a thief! My money! Thief! I never said it was a free puppet show. Hey! Grab her! Aw, give me back my puppet! Stop! Huh? I have your Tokage! Cut it out. I'm trying to look threatening. Put… him… down! Oh. Hyah! Hyah! Hah! Yeep yeep! Are you okay? Speak to me! Crud. Huh? Hyah! Yeep, yeep, yeep. It's the Mogura. The third most dangerous crew in all of Neo Edo! Third most dangerous? We're obviously number one. I was gonna let you go. Look, everyone. See who's gettin' a beat down today? Chikabuma! Huh? Who is Chikabuma and why is he getting a beatdown? No, no, that's not what I mean. I am Chikabuma. And you, my friend, are gettin' a beatdown. -But, uh-- Shut up, you yonk. Silence! You have interrupted snapping practice. Okay, is something going to happen, or… Get 'em! Huh? Hyah! We gotta get outta here before they do another power snap! Hmm? Hyah! Oof. Hyah! Yeep! Not cool. Chikabuma! Hey! My puppet's back there! You wanna go get it? Not for a million joules. Ooh! I call dibs! Oh, that should pay for a new puppet. Hmm, maybe two or three. I'm glad it all worked out. So, my name is Usagi, and I'd like to apologize for-- Hyah! Okay, I can see you're still mad. Yeep yeep. Huh? Oof. Ow. Yeep. Yeep. Those were priceless. Oh, good. I was afraid they were valuable. I just swept in here! Everyone, out. Now! We just want to smash that guy. Oh. Okay. Go ahead. Yeep. What is up with you? I've gotten a dozen complaints about power fluctuations in the last hour. Eep. Hyah! Whoa. Eep, eep! Chizu! What are they doing in here? I ordered them out, sir. Who are you? Hi! I'm Kitsune. I'm Gen, and I got no beef with you. I'm just here for the rabbit. I'm U-- Nobody cares who you are! Shut up! You're all upsetting the Ki-Stone. Whoa. That's the Ki-Stone? I thought it would be fancier. And more yellow. Maybe with some like, lines around it, like rays shooting out and-- Ow! Ow! Why is my face so stabby? Can we have a time-out? I wanna look at the Ki-Stone! Desist! I am Tetsujin, the last of the Kaikishi. And I will not be disrespected. The Kaikishi? The ancient order of Yokai fighters? How can he be a Yokai fighter when there haven't been any Yokai for a thousand years? Hah! They're just old stories. They were never real. Hah! Everybody shut up! There are still Kaikishi. I am the only one left. This is the ancient Kaikishi Temple. Um… Sir? Not now, Chizu. And you! Sir! Why do you look like Miyamoto Usagi? He was my ancestor. Oof. Embarrassing. Why is it doing that? Oh. That's not good at all. It's you! You're the reason the Ki-Stone's messing up! It's so cool. Like if you had a friend who was lightning. Stop! Ah! Oof! Huh? Are those… Those look like… Yokai! Yes! Tomorrow, I ask for a raise. Huh? Huh! Miyamoto Usagi. After all these centuries of imprisonment, it is you! I'm flattered, but actually I'm Yuichi Usagi-- Silence! You are to blame for my suffering. I have waited a thousand years to destroy you!","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-Y7","Word Count":1732,"Year Published":2022,"Season & Episode":"S01E01"},"example_id":"54c6ee3b-2a18-4884-a754-decd3aa44251","annotations":[{"end":42,"tag":"Behavioral","start":34,"value":"beatdown","tag_id":"4e4637f2-48c3-452e-b7db-d1cace295a4d","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"54c6ee3b-2a18-4884-a754-decd3aa44251","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:56:52.046+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:52:24.714+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T15:08:56.455+00:00","annotator_id":5}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"b2070e57-c427-494d-a48b-62e66fd6116c"},{"end":7,"tag":"Biological Kind","start":4,"value":"you","tag_id":"b3c56c74-2d45-483d-945d-9103cf870c36","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"54c6ee3b-2a18-4884-a754-decd3aa44251","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:56:48.131+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:52:19.724+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T15:08:56.45+00:00","annotator_id":5}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"c6f9be1d-8a0b-461c-ae64-a0e2f13d52ae"},{"end":18,"tag":"Social Kind/Role","start":12,"value":"friend","tag_id":"c2d08238-bcff-4c44-af7c-74c991a2afb3","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"54c6ee3b-2a18-4884-a754-decd3aa44251","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:52:23.373+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T15:08:56.454+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:56:48.134+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"74336d88-87d3-4adb-9ad0-6e2ac0ec2006"}],"classifications":[]},{"content":"Come here, you little dancer.","seen_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","annotator_id":5}],"comments":[],"metadata":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"Ease":57.95,"Genre":null,"Grade":6.2,"Notes":null,"Title":"Not Quite Narwhal","Author":null,"Source":"Netflix","Age Max":6,"Age Min":0,"Content":"Whee!

I am Pixie Dazzlerump, and this is my little sister, Juniper Pom Pom Dazzlerump. I'm Kelp Tuskington. I've never met anybody who looks like me before. Are you narwhals too? Hmm? Oh, we're unicorns.

That's what I wanted to show you. Wow! What are you staring at? Did that bubble just come out of my tusk? Kelp, you just did the Unicorn Spark. And that's not a tusk. It's a horn.

You can tell us anything. The place I just went to, I learned I'm not a narwhal. I'm a unicorn. Well, you know what, we've always known you were different. It's why you're so special. And that's just one of the many things we love about you. So you knew I was a unicorn all along? Well, we'd heard about unicorns, but we weren't sure. And it didn't matter to us. Well, now what? What do you mean? I mean, what am I? Am I a land narwhal or a sea unicorn? Do you have to choose? Ever since we found you inside that giant clamshell, you've been part of our family. Really?

Kazuza is seven years old. I have him, uh, since he was, uh, six months. I believe there is a special bond between, uh, humans and dogs. And that's something I realized when I spent a lot of time with Kazuza. He looks at me, uh, and you realize… …what I feel, we don't need words. But these two aren't here for the bracing walks. This is where Bruno indulges in his favorite pastime. Base jumping. I start base jumping, uh, around six and a half, uh, years. It gave me a life. So, I don't consider it a sport, really. I love that you are in the nature. It's therapy. Every time I was about to jump, I was asking my friends to take care of him. And they were saying that once I jumped, he… he was trying to go towards me. And that's what led me to think that he might wanted, uh, want to jump. It's a action dog. In households across the world, pets are at the heart of family life. They share our homes, but how well do we really know them? In this series we'll dig deep into our pets' inner lives to discover the secrets they've kept hidden until now. From spectacular feats of communication… Alexa. …to extreme athleticism. -Extraordinary intelligence… …and incredible super senses. We'll meet remarkable pets from across the globe… Come. …whose owners have harnessed their hidden skills and shared them with the world… …and use groundbreaking technology to reveal how amazing their brains and bodies really are. In Switzerland, base jumper Bruno made a bold decision and constructed a harness for his border collie, Kazuza. I think about every single detail in order to reduce the risk as maximum as possible. We put a harness on him. I got to the ledge. He was super relaxed, super quiet, looking down. Okay, five seconds! Yeah. Five seconds. All the signs that he was, uh, not stressing, not feeling scared. Yeah. Kazuza! We jumped, and it was beautiful. Having my dog, uh, flying with me, amazing. Like humans, dogs have an innate sense of self-preservation, but Kazuza's bond with Bruno means his emotional intelligence overcomes his instincts, to the extent that he's prepared to leap from a 2,000-foot cliff with him. I feel very comfortable, and Kazuza was feeling the same way, maybe because he trusts me. And he knew that, uh, if he was with me, uh, then everything is good. I have him as a very smart dog, so he definitely would run away from everything related with jumping or flying if he would not like it, that's 100% guaranteed. Ai, ai, ai. On the landing, he just starts to whip his tail, and he's laughing. He's super stoked. Whoo! I try to take the harness from him, it's super hard. He kind of wants to keep the harness 'cause then maybe there's a chance of going again. This tremendous trust is only possible because Kazuza is intelligent enough to read Bruno's body language. Well, I think every dog, they have something special, but him, yeah, uh, it's like, uh, he's like a person. Some person's soul reincarnated on him. Kazuza is like a son. Modern family life is full of opportunities, and our pets have learned to enjoy the ride. And the more fun they have, the smarter they become. This is Snowball, rescue parrot and Internet dance sensation. His enthusiastic moves and remarkable sense of rhythm have earned him nearly seven million views across social media. But they also caught the attention of John Iverson and fellow neuroscientists at the University of California. We saw the video on YouTube, and our jaw just literally drop… dropped to the floor. Snowball is a sulphur-crested cockatoo living at a parrot sanctuary in Indiana. As soon as John and his team saw him, they knew there was more to his behavior than just a funny video. We were speechless when we saw Snowball dancing. What was amazing about it was Snowball was really listening to the music and really feeling the beat. Snowball was revealing astonishing intelligence, and the neuroscientists contacted his owner Irena for more footage. They worked out Snowball was entertaining his millions of adoring fans around the world by busting an incredible 14 unique dance moves. What we noticed along the way was that as we continued on these studies, that his repertoire of movements seemed to be getting larger. This really seems almost like a kind of a creativity. I just want you But it should be known that… that all of his moves, uh, he invented those himself. Irena made it clear that, uh, he wasn't copying her. And if you see the headbangs, unless Irena is a total heavy metal fan, that's definitely his own thing. I just want you back So what exactly is going on in Snowball's brain? You still wanna dance, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Like other members of the parrot family, his dancing skills are connected to his ability to mimic sounds and speech. It's not fair! It's not fair! It isn't. There's no question that to be able to dance, you need a strong connection between the part of your brain that hears and the part of your brain that moves. Speech and music are very similar, both being a collection of tones and rhythms. John's theory is that if you have an area of the brain that processes speech, and it's linked to the area of the brain that makes your body move, you can dance. Snowball can dance by himself to music, but he's much more likely to dance if he has a partner. And it turns out Snowball isn't the only groover. Parrots around the world are having a ball expressing themselves through dance. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! To the best of our knowledge, some of these movements are in fact found in the wild in courtship dances. But it's not known if birds dance to music in the wild, so one idea we have is to… to get a Humvee with a huge stereo, drive out to the outback, and just play the music, and see what happens. Yeah. Yeah. The more we enrich our pet's world… - -…the happier they become. But that's not all. Our pets' cognitive abilities can be boosted to extraordinary levels with the right environment. To prove it, scientists at the University of Richmond are gearing up for a race like no other. The drivers that have emerged from the rat pack as the more competent drivers, are Sophia and Aletheia. Sophia means wisdom, and Aletheia, truth. So, with truth and wisdom at the wheel, who can lose? And so that's what this race is all about. They've been trained individually, and then we're putting them together. Sophia is driving the red car and Aletheia, the yellow. Sophia gets off to a flyer. Aletheia hesitates. Could it have cost her? The lead widens. Sophia crosses the line to scoop first prize, a treat tree laden with food. I don't care what kind of mood you're in, when you see a rat driving a car, it's almost like seeing a… a pig fly or something, people laugh. Professor Kelly Lambert has studied rats for 35 years. She's fascinated by their ability to adapt to new challenges. Rats don't have a great reputation, but I see rats through a different lens. They're survivors, and they're very intelligent. Six years ago, she was looking for a new way of testing them. A colleague asked me about rats driving cars, and I said, \"No, why would I want to do that?\" But then, once you think about that, you can't not think about it. So, before I knew it, we were having coffee, thinking about what the car would look like, and how would you get it to activate the car, and thinking about the behavior of the animals. Kelly also wanted to see if the rats' environment affected their ability to learn. Most rats in laboratories are housed in various standard cages. They have all the food, everything they need to live, but it's not engaging or interesting. Brains need engagement. So we've done a lot with these enriched environments, larger environments with more social interactions and objects to interact with. It's almost like a rat Disneyland. And being in that enriched environment seems to prepare the animals to learn new skills, if you will, or new tasks. Of the six in the rat palace, the team felt that Sophia and Aletheia showed the most potential. Not least because they were both rather partial to a Froot Loop. Hey. Erin Burns is chief treat distributor. We start by putting the Froot Loops through the top of the cage, and then slowly we'll introduce Froot Loops in the car environment and we'll let them kinda eat the Froot Loops, explore the car. Then we'll put the Froot Loops in the car, try to make that a positive experience for them. It culminates with the rats learning how to drive. They need to stand close to the lever to get the reward, and then they need to touch the lever to get the reward. So we're shaping. And then they have to press the lever, and keep it down to drive the car, and to keep driving to get to the Froot Loop. It took six weeks for Aletheia and Sophia to learn to go forward. But that was only the start, and they soon progressed to more advanced driving. Once rats learn the concept of driving forward, we would put that treat tree where they could not get it driving forward, they had to turn. Soon, there was simply no stopping them. They're learning the concept of direction and steering, uh, kind of like a skill. So it kind of blew my mind. And every time I look at them, I still go, \"Wow.\" Seems to be positive experience for the animals that allows us to learn more about how the brain learns and adapts to these very complex challenges. Kelly's work with racing rats is proving without question that if you give your pet a happy, stimulating life, you'll see a difference in its behavior. So it's important to challenge, uh, your pets, and have different things that they can play and to be active, we need to be active. And the rats in the enriched environment, they're running around more and climbing, and that's very good for their brains to be physically active. Thankfully, rats driving cars haven't hit our highways just yet. But in suburban Los Angeles, one pet lives in an enriched environment that's taking him to new heights. This is Shai Lighter, and like many doting pet owners, he relishes the prospect of seeing his companion at the end of a working day. I love the feeling, when I'm going back home, and somebody is waiting for me. Bini, come. Come. Come. It's great that someone is coming to greet me. And bunnies can get affectionate. It comes and licks me. They're lovable, they're… they're like dogs. Bini is a Holland Lop Rabbit who's been in Shai's care for nine years. As a baby, Bini was always, erm, very curious, and he always liked to explore the apartment. I used to look in his eyes, and he was looking at me, like trying to understand what I'm telling him. And this is when I realized that he's more than just a bunny. Bini, come. Shai decided to open up his hutch, and give Bini the run of the apartment. If a rabbit is locked in a cage or a hutch, they wouldn't interact with their owner. You won't get the same connection with them, and you can't do anything with them. Uh, and then people are surprised, \"Oh, my rabbit is not smart as yours.\" Of course not. You need to… to be with them. Jump! Yay! Another jump! Another jump! Sure enough, it wasn't long before Shai saw a whole new side to his pet. One day, I caught Bini playing with a ball in a box, and I decided that this can be like a basketball game. So I changed the box with a basketball hoop, and I gave him a basketball ball, and… Hello. And showed him some tricks and then I gave him food. And he knew that this is the game. He learned the tricks very well, and he likes the game because he developed the game for himself. And we play this game every day before we go to sleep. Bini eventually bounced into the Guinness Book of World Records for the most slam dunks ever scored by a rabbit in a minute: seven. Not only the basketball. One day, I caught him playing with markers on the floor, and I got very mad because the floor was very messy. Then I decided, \"You know what? It could be like the basketball.\" \"If he likes to play with something, let him play.\" Come, Bini. So, I changed the markers with paintbrushes, and I bought some canvases. I showed him what to do, I gave him the paintbrush. And he just, like, he started to paint. Here you go. I'm surprised, like, I have, like, a Picasso rabbit at home. I think rabbits have great memory. Bini learns so many tricks, and he never forgets them. Sometimes it's kind of like reading minds, I just show him the trick, then he started to do it. It's always shocking. Bini, come. With patience, love, and plenty of treats, Shai has shown how remarkable a relaxed rabbit can be. I believe that all rabbits can learn tricks. Like, just give them food and the attention they need and love, and they need to know that they are secure. Um. And that's how they know that they can trust you. Thanks to social media, the joy of living with our pets can be shared with the world. This disappearing act is a hit. It may confuse the dogs, but it shows they know when we're messing with their minds. The more we play, the more pets are revealing their astonishing social intelligence. Jack and Nikki are a pair of African grey parrots who are helping scientists with their research at the Loro Parque Foundation in Tenerife. They are actually siblings, and they have a very close bond with each other. This brother-and-sister bond is changing the way we think about parrot behavior. They and 44 other parrots belong to the Max Planck Comparative Cognition team that Anastasia Krasheninnikova has been working with for over ten years. Parrots are quite special among all the birds. Uh, parrots have very large brains. What I've learned is that it doesn't actually matter how do we think that the parrot will behave. We can be 100% sure that, um, it will surprise us. The research team came up with an experiment to test the sociability of African greys… with mind-blowing results. First of all, they taught Nikki and Jack a simple rule. We, um, trained the parrots to use, um, tokens, metal washers, as a kind of currency that they can use, um, like we use money to buy food. They separated the siblings using a screen with a hole in it. At first, both Nikki and Jack are able to exchange the tokens for food. But then, Anastasia seals Nikki's window. Now, Nikki has the tokens, but no means of getting the food. What happens next is astonishing. Nikki starts to pass the tokens to Jack so that he can get the food. They realize that the partner is in need, and they try to help. We were very impressed because this is the first time for birds, um, that we could show that they spontaneously and voluntarily help each other. And this kind of kindness is actually very rare in animal kingdom. When Anastasia blocks Jack's window, the tables are turned, and this time Nikki benefits. Using a number of parrots, Anastasia discovered that the closer the bond, the more tokens they passed each other. What we see here is something like, \"You scratch my back, I will scratch yours.\" So the more tokens, um, one bird gives to… to its partner, the more tokens it will get back. This teamwork requires both intelligence and empathy. It comes from an understanding of how to help a friend. Parrots are very, um, social animals, and their groups have a very complex social structure. And this kindness can be helpful to maintain, um, some particular relationships. I think it highlights just how clever they are and that we should be very respectful, um, towards parrots, but also other animals. Looking out for each other is an integral part of our relationship with our pets. And sometimes, the way this manifests itself surprises everyone. - - Nine-year-old lurcher Bill has a favorite spot in his garden. It's where his sister Ruby is buried. She's buried in the garden under a rose bush. And he used to lay there all the time. I always find him there in the summer. Does he know she's there, having been buried, you know? I'd like to think he does. I think he does. I like to think he knows. I'd like to think he knows. Yeah. Russell and Michelle doted on Bill and Ruby since they were pups. Good girl, Rubs. Good girl. Come on. For six years, Bill and Ruby were inseparable, until tragedy struck. She had, um, kidney failure, and we had to say goodbye. Never been apart. Very close. Very, very close, yeah. All of a sudden, his sister's disappeared and not there. And then, when she was gone, he was, like, just… Just quiet. …quiet. For a bit. Just getting used to being one dog. Didn't want to let go of us. Wants to be around us. More clingy. Suppose it must have been… He must have felt lonely himself. A recent study of dogs that lost a companion revealed that many of them showed altered behavior, which can be a sign of depression, with 80% of them becoming more affectionate to their owners. This is exactly what Russell and Michelle noticed in Bill. He started to follow them everywhere. Then, when Michelle hurt her back, it became clear that Bill had a caring personality. I was in a lot of pain. My back was really, really painful, and I couldn't really move. And he was just sort of there, sat there with me, guarding me, almost. Because I was crying in pain. Put his head on me. A reassurance or some… Yeah, that's what he's doing. Big time. But the couple didn't realize just how empathetic Bill was until Russell broke his ankle window cleaning. When I was getting used to my crutches and the plaster, I didn't take much notice of Bill. Not that I didn't want to, I just concentrated on getting around. So I didn't notice nothing. Until Michelle had said something. Poor Bill appeared to have hurt his leg too. Or had he? When I saw the video, I couldn't really believe it. If you look, it's a very over-exaggerated limp. But strangely, it seemed Bill was able to turn his limp on and off. If he was out in the garden with me or I took him for a walk, he seemed to be fine. Didn't seem to have any problems at all. For two days, Bill continued to behave like this with Russell and like this with Michelle. Concerned, the couple took him to the vet. Didn't limp walking in, and I said to Michelle, \"They're not gonna find nothing now 'cause he's not limpin'.\" They done several things, tests and whatever they did. And they couldn't find a thing. No. Come on. Go on. Come here. Wait. Scientists have proved that dogs have incredible empathy for their owners. But Bill's empathy was on a new level. He appeared to be pretending to suffer to make Russell feel loved. I think that's clever. He's decided that he wants to limp as well by just looking at me, and thinking, \"Oh, perhaps I should be doing the same.\" Who's my good boy? Come on, then. Go on. I do think dogs are amazing. I think they make a home a home. Imitation may be the best form of flattery, but it's also a sure sign of brain power. Helping our pets crack the trickiest tasks. This is Gambit, a bearded dragon. A gate currently separates him from his favorite food, mealworms. He doesn't know it yet, but the only way to get at them is to slide the door to the right. Poor Gambit. So near, but so far. Until recently, lizard experts would have doubted his ability to solve the problem. But scientists have devised an experiment to see if bearded dragons can learn problem-solving by watching each other. They've trained a bearded dragon to slide the gate open and filmed it. Gambit watches the \"how to\" movie. What will he do now? Astonishing. Gambit has made the connection between what he's seen on a screen and his own real-life problem and solved it. This form of social learning is a sure sign of intelligence. Our pets' intelligence connects us to them. But it's also what they most value in each other. - Meet budgies Debbie and Bubba. There's no doubt that his gorgeous plumage makes Bubba a very pretty boy. Debbie seems to agree. But here comes Albert who clearly has his eye on Debbie. Bubba's sitting pretty for now. But look out, Bubba, Albert has a trick up his sleeve. A ground-breaking study has revealed that it's not just looks that females go for. Albert has been trained to get food by solving a puzzle. Nice work, and it's not gone unnoticed. Bubba's keen to prove he's just as smart. But without training, there's no chance. It's got Debbie thinking. In the original study, only half the male budgies were trained to solve a puzzle. The female budgies overwhelmingly preferred the birds with brains. A reflection, perhaps, of their wild origins where finding food is crucial. Sorry, Bubba, this time it's the geek with the beak that wins the girl. - We've seen how pets have used their intelligence to master our modern world, but that's not all. It's their intelligence that also allows them to conquer our hearts. Okay. Next time… - …communication, the Holy Grail for pets everywhere. What are you doing? -What are you doing? Love you. Love you too. How technology is giving pets a voice. It was a light bulb moment for both of us. And how the more we understand them, the more they're transforming our lives. Nothing could happen to me because he will protect me. It blows my mind how Ted can make people so happy. Teddy. I love him.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-G","Word Count":3840,"Year Published":2022,"Season &

No. Not at all. Izzy, what are we doing in the middle of the Bridlewood forest… at night? It's a surprise! If I told you, you wouldn't be surprised! She does have a point there. You're gonna love it. Hoof to heart. Come on! It's just up here! Oh yeah. Uh… Oof, ow. We're here! Ta-da! Uh… Izzy? Is something supposed to happen? Hush. Wow! Gorgeous! Awesome! What? Wow. I've never seen anything like this in my life! This is amazing, Izzy! What is it? It's called the \"Lumi-Bloom\"! Every moon season, for one week only, all of the plants and stuff in this part of Bridlewood go all wild and glowy! So it's not just some sort of Unicorn spell? Just a natural phenomenon? Yup! Do you like it? Like it?! Do I like it? I love it! It makes me wanna sing. Oh my glow. Did you guys just see that?! Yeah, huh, that was actually really cool. I have to do it again! Quick, get it on camera this time! Ha, wait! What's wrong? I just had an even better idea. We can share this beautiful sight with everypony if we bring them all here… Whoa. How are we gonna do that? By hosting the biggest and brightest musical festival that Equestria's ever seen… or heard. That sounds so magical! I love it! But Izzy said the bloom only lasts a week. Which means… we're already running out of time! We have to get started right now. Huh? Yes… Sing for us, ponies. Hm. Ah-ha! Hmm! Whatcha doing? Making my dreams come true! Because if you can dream it, you can do it, Izzy. I just dreamed that I crafted an entire sailboat out of tortilla chips. See? I love that for you! And I love this for me! But if I want to make the Bridlewoodstock Music Festival happen, I can't waste a single minute. Everypony has to see the Lumi-Bloom before it's over! It is pretty special, huh? Which is why I'm going to need help today. We'll have to bring in everything and fast. Uh… Tents, stages, sound equipment, decorations, and of course… musicians! Wait. Why does your face look like that? Well… Uh, I don't want to burst your excitement bubbles, but… there is a little teensy weensy problem with that particular spot. Um. Maybe we should have the festival somewhere else! A problem? Umm… it's just that we… we Unicorns think it's kinda Jinxie to sing or make any loud noises during the Lumi-Bloom because of the… the Troggles. Is that it? An old \"Jinxie\" rumor? Psst! Ha! No, it's not a rumor! There's even a poem! It goes like this… \"Eyes of the monster, form of the pig Sing laugh or yell, step hoof on a twig\" Iz! Iz! Iz! Iz! It's going to be fine. Once the Unicorns hear the amazing music with the glowy sights, they won't even remember that silly poem! It will be that life-changing. Trust me! Yeah. I guess you could be right. I've never actually seen a Troggle. See? Okay, let's do it! Bridlewoodstock, here we come! Good morning! Breakfast? Yes, please. Thanks, Sunny, but I've gotta fly. Too much to do! Emergency music festival planning meeting at Mane Melody later! Be there! At least take a smoothie to-go! Wow. Who doesn't have time for a smoothie? A pony on a mission, that's who. Here we go. Everypony, brace yourselves for a wild week. Pegasi love music festivals. They're kind of a big deal in Zephyr Heights. Pipp has always wanted to plan one of her own. So she must be feeling the pressure to make it perfect. What do you mean? She did stay up all night working! Then we have to help her out. Uh-huh. I want to lean into the Lumi-Bloom theme and go full Flower Fest. Flower crowns! Snack tents featuring edible flowers! Where does the music part come in? I am glad you asked, Jazz. The Mane Stage! What bands are gonna play? Yeah! That's where you ponies come in! How? We're not a band… Yet. No, no, no, no, no. I need you ponies to help me secure some amazing bands while I work on… everything else! I think we can get Electric Blue. The super epic Pegasus rock band? Wow Hitch, I didn't know you were such a musical expert! I know things. And I am dying to have the incredible new pop artist, Ruby Jubilee perform. I love her! Me too! Everypony does. Her vocals are unreal. Which is why she's going to be hard to lock down on such short notice. But we have to try, right? Right. But we still need an incredible Earth Pony or Unicorn band to round out the lineup. Any ideas? I know! I know! We could get… The Dreamlands! No way! They're this really famous Earth Pony trio that I loved when I was younger. They practically invented the genre of \"girl group\" music. But they haven't performed in moons. How would we find them? I have a connection. I know ponies. Actually, my Grandma Figgy does. She used to bake for the lead singer, Minty! This is all coming together like perfection! Rocky and Jazz, you're on style duty! Zipp, you go get Electric Blue! You got it! Sunny and Hitch, find those Dreamlands! And Izzy, you and I will convince Ruby Jubilee to dazzle us! Yeah! Okay! On it! Yeah! Do whatever you have to do, just get those bands to come to Bridlewoodstock! Oh… Alright, how hard could this be? Hey! Electric Blue? Huh? Zipp. Uh… who? Uh… Princess Zipp? Oh, hey, Princess. How's your sister? She's great! Actually, that's why I wanted to talk to you. But it's top-secret. Can we… can… Can we get out of here? Yeah. I'm down with that. Hey, guys, let's go! Phew. Hey! Up here! Pipp sent me to find you guys because she wants to invite you… …we want to invite you to play at Bridlewoodstock! Uh, what's that? It's the very first music festival in Bridlewood and it's gonna be so… uh… so… rockin'? Yeah! Hmm… Hmm… So, uh… What do you think? We're not sure. Maybe I didn't explain right! So there's a thing called the Lumi-Bloom, right? And all the plants and flowers and crystals glow! And it looks awesome! Imagine those visuals with one of your sets. I mean, really cool and uh… You'll be the headliners! Well, why didn't you lead with that? Of course we'll play. Great! Phew! I can't believe we're about to meet Ruby Jubilee! This is our big chance to work with the newest, most talented chart-topper! Do I look okay? Your sparkle is shining bright! It's got a cutie mark on it. \"Your Majesty Princess Petals…\" That's me! \"…Miss Ruby Jubilee sends her deepest regrets. She cannot join you today due to a case of… creative block!\" Maybe we can help her! My thoughts exactly. Princess Pipp?! Sorry to surprise you like this, but my friend Izzy and I got your note and we had to help. We've had creative block, too. We get it. Oh, Princess. It's just… ugh, awful! What's going on? You can talk to us. After the success of my debut single, I've just been putting so much pressure on myself to top it with a new hit! Ugh, but how do you top a chart-topper? Ruby, you have no idea how much I understand what you're going through. Me too! But luckily, we have some tricks up our hooves to help. You do? Yes! First, try not to be inspired when you watch this. My stars. That is the most magical sight I've ever seen! It makes me think of… Quick! I need to write this idea down before I forget! You're already inspired! And it's even better in real life! You have to see it. At the Bridlewoodstock festival! Onstage! Will you perform for us? I don't know. Wild rubies are in season in Bridlewood! You love rubies! Mmm, I really do. And… you'll be the headliner! Wow. Okay! Now I'm really inspired! I'll do it. You sure we'll find her here, Figgy? Oh yes. This is where Minty comes to do her weekly shop! I run into her all the time. You're so cool, Granny! So are you, Hitchie. Look, over there! That's her all right. Well, don't dawdle now. Scoot! Um, excuse me. Are you Minty? Yes. Why? I'm Sunny and this is Hitch. And we're big fans of yours and we wanted to know if maybe you would consider getting the group back together to play at our music festival this weekend? After all, coincidentally, it's the anniversary of your very first hit single! Yeah! Anniversaries should be celebrated, don't you think?! Heh. Sorry. Sometimes when I get nervous, I talk really fast. It's true. She does. So what do you think, Minty? I don't know. The Dreamlands broke up moons and moons ago. Even if I could convince Snuzzle and Blue Belle, we're so out of practice. Oh, I know the perfect place you can practice! It's called Mane Melody and it's got a stage and everything. It's not just that. Then what is it? Does anypony even care about our little girl group anymore? Of course they do! You're the originals! You're what started it all! Figgy! I hope my grandson and his friend aren't bothering you too much. But I told them I'd help convince you to give it a try. It'd be so wonderful to see you girls singing together again. Is there a key lime pie in the deal? Already baked it! Okay then… I guess we'll do it. As long as we're not pushed aside at some little stage for \"old timers\" while the flashy new acts play the mane stage. We have to make a splash if we're making a comeback! You know what? I have an even better idea. The Dreamlands will be the headliners! Let's do it! Yes! Yeah! Hey! Huh? I talked to Electric Blue! They're gonna do it! We convinced Minty to get the Dreamlands to play! And we got Ruby Jubilee! Which you knew already! Great work, everypony! I knew I could count on you. Now we just have to set up an entire festival! Easy peasy! Everypony get ready! The music is coming-to-town! The music festival, that is. It's called \"Bridlewoodstock\"! You're gonna love it! Loud music?! During the Lumi-Bloom? Of course! Isn't it the most beautiful thing you've ever witnessed? Now it will have a soundtrack! This is a very bad idea! Count me out! Um… Is it just me or do these Unicorns seem kind of… Not into the idea? Yeah. They are definitely freaked out about something. So… Are there any amazing local Bridlewood musicians who would love to perform at the show? Oh! Onyx! Dapple! You two would be perfect additions to the lineup, heh. What do you say? No. Oh, well that's okay, heh. You still have time to mull it over. Uh, we don't need time. You don't? Because we Unicorns know better. You should never sing during a Lumi-Bloom because of the… …Troggles! \"Eyes of the monster, form of the pig Sing laugh or yell, step hoof on a twig Troggles appear, steal what's to be No cure to be found, past the red ruby\" Okay, I… I give up. What are these Troggle thingies? Legend says… that the Troggles are mystical spirit monsters! Th-th-they only come out during the bloom! And they steal things from you if you make any noise! But they can only work their spirit magic at night… so beware of singing! Or you'll be cursed! Bing bong! Bing bong! Bing bong! Bing bong! Bing bong! Bing bong! Oh. Is that all? Come to the Bridlewoodstock Music Festival and I, Princess Pipp, guarantee you the greatest sights your eyes have ever seen and sounds your ears will ever hear! Yes, that is correct. It's called the \"Lumi-Bloom\". And we'll have the hottest musical acts in the industry. The Dreamlands, Electric Blue, and… Ruby Jubilee! That's Bridlewoodstock Music Festival, okay! In Bridlewood! Be there or um… You know what? Just be there, everypony! Looking great, everypony! Take five! Hello! Home sweet Mare Stream! Thanks for setting it up! Isn't luxury glamping the best? I love to glamp! It helps me forget about all my worries. Aw. What do you have to worry about? Uh… Want a toasted marshmallow? You're right. My worries have melted away! Yes! Yeah. Me too, me too! Huh? Uh… Hmm… Oh no. What's wrong now? Did one of the bands back out?! No, nothing like that. It's just… Are you absolutely sure we should be having the festival here? Ah, why wouldn't we? It's literally gorgeous. Um, but you heard what Onyx said earlier about the legend, right? With the Troggles? Um… Why? Have you seen anything… Troggle-y? Trust me, there's nothing to worry about. Besides, look at this place already. Everything is coming together like the harmonies on my last single! Izzy! Is that what I think it is? If you think it's my flower crown booth, then yes. Want a sneaky peek? Yeah, I do! And I want all of you to stay here in our amazing Mare Stream and relax! Toast some marshmallows! Should we do something to stop all this? I don't know. Things do look fine, at least… And we worked so hard to get the bands to agree to play. Which reminds me, I have to go! Minty invited me to watch The Dreamlands dress rehearsal back home and I'm pretty excited about it. See you ponies later! I don't really want to ruin Pipp's festival… but are you still feeling uneasy about those strange Unicorn warnings, too? Actually, yes. You know what I think this calls for? An investigation? Boom. You got it. Come on! This isn't working, Minty! Snuzzle is right. Ugh, why did we agree to this, anyway? We're washed up! No, we're not! They're going to laugh at us. We just need to run it a few more times. Come on, let's just try it again from the top. And a one, two… a one, two, three. Ha! Sorry I'm late! I came straight from Bridlewood! Sunny! So glad you're here. This is not going well… Hey! Watch where you're going! You're in my way! Stop it, you two! Has it been like this the whole time? As soon as they walked in the door. They can't agree on anything! And they haven't even made it through their whole song once. Maybe I can fix this. That's it, I'm done. Fine! Ah… Minty! Looking fresh! How is everything going? Oh Sunny. Don't act like you didn't just see that. It's a disaster! The dance moves are off, our looks are dated, and… We can't agree on what song to perform. Blue Belle thinks we should try and update our sound to appeal to a younger audience, but that's not so easy. I think this might be a no-go for The Dreamlands. Sorry, Sunny. Hey, wait! Don't give up! And don't try to change yourselves. Your classic sounds are what everypony loves about you! You just have to do what you do best and you're gonna rock that stage. Yeah! Hmm. Huh. Hmm. What can you tell us about Troggles? Troggles? Where? Hmm. Hey! Uh, do you ponies know that Jinxie poem? About the Tro-- Shh! Yeah, but I don't wanna say it! What?! Yeah, I mean… like what is a Troggle anyway, you know? Like when you think about it, what is anything? I think I've come to a conclusion. Well? The results are inconclusive. I can't tell if these monster spirit things are real or just another piece of spooky Unicorn lore! Me neither. But I think we need to talk to Pipp again. Before it's too late. Mm-hmm. Hey, ponies! We wanna talk to you about something. Wait, wait! Have you seen the mane stage yet? Come look first! Wow, Pipp. That looks really cool! Don't you love the rubies? I had them locally harvested from Bridlewood in honor of Ruby Jubilee's big performance! I'm just so thrilled with how everything is coming together with no snags at all! Well, about that… There's kind of a snag that we wanted to discuss. Uh, Princess Pipp! We need you at artist tent setup! Please! Be right there! Thanks for stopping by! Am I the only one who is worried about all this Troggle stuff? Look! There are even Unicorns on board with the festival now. Then maybe you are just trying to dig up trouble where there isn't any. You're right. Maybe sometimes… …there just isn't any mystery to solve. And that's okay. You know what? I'm gonna try and have fun tomorrow. Lean into the whole music festival experience. For my sister. Me too! Welcome to Bridlewoodstock, everypony! This is all gonna be okay, right? Even after all the stuff those Unicorns said? I really hope so. Pipp really pulled things together fast, huh? Heh. That's my little sister for ya. When she wants something, she will make it happen! Well, I'm impressed. This place looks awesome! Very floral. Yeah, it does. Alright, I'll admit it. I am a little excited. And I can't wait to see Electric Blue headline the show! Huh. I thought The Dreamlands were headlining the show? Hey, look! There's Izzy's booth! Hey, Iz. What's all this? The Flower-fication Station! Station! Station! It's so much fun, it's almost making me forget about how super Jinxie this all this. Take a seat! Okay! Wait, what did you just say, Izzy? How did you just-- Wait! There's more! Yeah! Wow! Now you're really festival ready! Yeah, we are! Thanks, Izzy. You're welcome! Have fun and don't let the Troggles bite! What was that? Umm… just some silly old Jinxie saying! Nothing to worry about! Probably. Okay, catch ya later! Who's hungry? I'm starving. Huh? Hungry. Hungry! Mm-hmm… Did you just hear that? Come on, let's get some snacks. Woo! Oh! This is taking forever. What are we in line for, again? Fries! With dipping sauces! Oh yeah. Huh. That does sound pretty delicious. Mmm. Dipping sauces. Yay! Zipp! We're almost there! There you two are! Ugh, thank hoofness, I've been looking everywhere! You look amazing, by the way. What the hay, Pipp?! I'm sorry, but this is a festival emergency! Come with me! But… but… dipping sauces! I don't want to alarm you, but this is bad. Like epically bad. Does this have to do with the Unicorn legend? We've been worried about that, too. Mmm-hmm. And so has Izzy, even if she won't admit it. Huh? We didn't want to upset you. But, you can be sure that Zipp and I will do whatever we can to minimize damage and help shut things down before it's too late. What? Why would you do that?! Because of the Troggles? Okay, I have no idea what you two are talking about, but we actually do have a serious problem on our hooves here. More serious than ancient ghost monsters? Yes! So two of our major musical acts, Electric Blue and Ruby Jubilee, are here! That's a good thing, though… right? Uh, it would be, if they didn't both think they're the headliner! I just don't understand how this mixup happened. Oh! I may have had something to do with that. Whoopsies? Zephyrina! What did you do? Hey, I was just trying to help you out! Electric Blue were on the fence about performing, so I uh… sweetened the deal by promising some stuff? Like I said, this is epically bad. What are we gonna do?! We'll just have to tell them the truth about what happened. I'm sure they'll understand. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! You do not tell a musician that they've been demoted from headliner! You just don't. Maybe they can double-headline! Is that a thing? That's not a thing, is it?! But it could be! If we make it one! Yeah! Yeah! That could work. And then, and then we'll still have plenty of other bands to go on first and open for them. Like The Dreamlands! Are they here yet? Where's Sunny? Right here! And your headliners have arrived! Here they are! Hey, everypony! We are really excited to be headlining a show after all this time! Thank you so much for this! We feel so special! On behalf of the royal family of Zephyr Heights and the um, uh… friendship fellowship of the Unity Crystals, we are so honored that you have graced us with your talents this fine evening at this celebration of the music. So are we! We weren't even sure we could perform together anymore, let alone headline a festival! Yes, yes. Well, please get comfortable as you warm your vocal chords and prepare for your grand performance! And do let us know if you require anything else, heh… We shall check in on you later, hmm? Why was she talking like that? Uh, Royals are fancy? Before you say anything, I know that I was just acting totally weird in there! As long as you know. I just panicked! But it's okay. We will come up with a plan and fast. But for now, all we have to do is keep the bands separated until the show, heh. We have time to figure it out! Umm, not to burst any more of your bubbles, but not really. It is almost dusk. If you want the full effect of the Lumi-Bloom, we gotta get started! Plus, the sooner we start the show, the less chance of any uh… unwanted visitors showing up! Okay. I'm not going to let anything ruin this. Not \"Troggies\", diva musicians, or… the sun setting! You're sounding pretty weird again, sis. I know! What's even weirder is triple headliners. We gotta fix this and convince one of the groups to open! So in conclusion, when you really think about it, opening the show is actually way better than going last because you'll be the first band in history to rock out to the visuals of the bloom! Alright, you got it. Hey, that was a great speech! Phew. So you know what I was thinking? Who wants to go last when everypony is too tired to sing and dance along? Really, being first up is the perfect place to be is what I always say! Hmm… You know… You have a really good point, Hitch. I think so, too. Let's do it. Let's go on first. Phew. Princess Pipp! I wanted to talk to you-- Okay, Ruby. It's all set. You are the star of the whole night! Our magnificent headliner on our stunning \"Ruby stage\"! Actually… I was kinda hoping you wouldn't mind if I go on first instead? What?! I love to sing during sunset. And it matches the exact vibe of the song you and Izzy inspired me to write! Oh so you wanna go first now? So now we have three openers and nopony who wants to be a headliner?! Yup. That's the situation. Mm-hmm. This just keeps on getting worse! Not to point out the obvious or anything, but uh… Aren't you a major pop star? A frequent headliner? A singer who loves attent-- Oh. Right. Yes. I am! I suppose I can perform, if everypony insists. Okay then, I'll do it. Woo-hoo! The show is saved! Maybe. Alright. Let's get this show started right now. Hey, Pipp? What's wrong now? My tummy feels like it's full of butterflies! I'm still kinda nervous that the Troggles might show up. No, no. That's just pre-show jitters! It is? Don't worry, everypony gets them. Even me! Just go trot it off! Okay. Phew. Huh. Welcome, everypony, to Bridlewoodstock! Please give a glowy, warm welcome to our first artist! The one… the only… Ruby Jubilee! Are you ready to get this pony party started?! Don't be afraid to sing along! Oh tell me can you hear That rockin' sound Oh oh If you listen You can hear it comin' round Oh oh Yeah we're movin' to a brand new beat Oh oh Oh oh And you can see us dancin' In the street Oh oh So call your favourite bestie yeah And bring 'em along 'Cause we're moving And we're shaking to her favourite song Oh oh Yeah, it's always in style Always in style Iconic, oh yeah You know it's magic Iconic, oh yeah You know it's classic Iconic, when we are together Iconic, yeah we are forever Iconic, yeah we are forever Oh, don't bother! The service out here is nonexistent. In Bridlewood, it's more about forest streams than streaming, you know? Be in the now, ponies! Forget those phonies! Yeah you can see them movin' Young and old oh oh Oh oh Dancin' together yeah They feel it in their soul Oh oh We're with all of our friends yeah We're singing along To the sparkle and the magic Of our favourite song Oh oh 'Cause they're always in style Oh yeah! Iconic, oh yeah You know it's magic Iconic, oh yeah You know it's classic Iconic, when we are together Iconic, yeah we are forever Iconic, yeah we are forever It's magic it's magic It's magic Iconic iconic Iconic What's happening? Technical difficulties? Oh no, her mic cut out! Oh no. Troggles! Oh no! Oh no! No way, dude! Don't take my voi-- Uh-oh. But… but… The show! Come on, ponies. We've gotta stop this! Yes! But first, we need a plan! \"Eyes of the monster, form of the pig! Sing laugh or yell, step hoof on a twig! Troggles appear, steal what's to be! No cure to be found, past the red ruby!\" Izzy, we don't have time for poems right now! Wait, did you basically just say that rubies can defeat the Troggles?! Huh! I guess I did! What? Everypony, grab those rubies! They're really stuck on there! That's because we used extra strength super-duper-Ruby glue! Why did we do that? Come on. My friends need my help. Yeah! Everypony away from the stage! Everypony! Catch a ruby! Ah-ha! Yeah! Hey! Hello? Hello! Uh, my voice is back. Iconic woah oh It worked! Ah, thank hoofness! Uh, is this thing on? Wow… So I just wanna say… that I'm sorry. To everypony. But especially to the residents of Bridlewood. This forest is your home and you know it best. You tried to warn me, but I didn't wanna listen to you or to my friends. Who only wanted to help make my dream of this festival come true. I guess I just got so focused on planning the perfect Bridlewoodstock festival, that I forgot to consider Bridlewood. And all of the history that comes along with it. Even the Jinxie stuff. But I know better now. And I wanna thank you all for coming to the first and last Bridlewoodstock. The festival is over! What?! Don't stop it now! This is most fun we've ever had during the Lumi-Bloom! Now that the Troggles are gone, we're not scared anymore! We want more music! Yeah! Let's go! We want more! We want more! What do you think, Ruby? I think the fans have spoken! Then the show must go on. What are we waiting for? Start the music! We have more incredible acts coming up! Please welcome… Electric Blue! How's everypony doin' tonight?! I'm Fretlock. There's Jam Donut on the bass, and there's Arpeggia on drums! And we are Electric Blue! Woo!

Once again, hear tell of Po, the Dragon Master! Revered in all of China for his bodacious skills. So self-confident he uses words like \"bodacious\" long after they've gone out of fashion. He has defeated the most dangerous and cunning enemies of China. He has risen to great levels of achievement and fame. He even has his own Happy Lunch toy, and is loved by the Emperor himself. And on top of all that, he has won Employee of the Month at his dad's noodle shop seven years in a row. Oh, no. Except that one time-- But it wasn't his fault. And now, with the land at peace, and inactivity making him slightly flabby and easily winded, he has accepted the challenge of a lifelong dream. A food tour of China! Oh, you deserve it, Po. Now, go out there, enjoy your fans, and realize that the best food in China… is made by me. Where are you going first? Pei-Pei's House of Fat Gobs in Wankun village, home of the WuGao Gauntlet. That thing's insanely powerful. I can't wait to check it out. Ah! Yay! Dragon Master! Hey. Hey! Mm! Hey, it's the Dragon Master. Look, it's Po. Oh, hey! Wow. Hey. Will you sign my parchment? Bye. See you later. Ah, I can smell those fat gobs already. The wait's almost over, buddy. Oh, man. The WuGao Gauntlet! So cool. Oh! But first, Pei-Pei's House of Fat Gobs. There he is. The Dragon Master. Oh! Dragon Master! Uh, hey guys, yes. It's me. Love you, too. Gotta keep moving. Mr. Dragon Master, can I have an autograph? Kiss the baby! K-Kiss the baby. No kissing. Nice to see you. I named my child after you. I wish I could stay. Let me get closer. I gotta keep it moving. Can you sign my nunchucks? Hey, hey, hey, okay. Watch the fur! Me, me, me! Y'all have no boundaries. Okay. Little space here. Guys. Okay, no touchy. I love you, bye. Whoa! Oh no, let me in! Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry. Please. But the crowd! I know. I fear for the safety of my restaurant. Please? So hungry. Do you have a private dining room? Okay, okay. Me too! Sign this for me! You can eat in here. No, I don't think I wanna-- Whoa! Wait, in the closet? Really? Hm. I'll fetch you a fat gob. I'm all alone in here. Alright, I know, I know. I'm hungry too. Oh hello, Radish. Hm? Huh? Stop them. Stop them! Somebody stop them. Not the gauntlet! And even though everyone's always asking, \"Where's the Dragon Master?\" no one asks, \"How's the Dragon Master?\" Huh. I never thought of it that way. That's what I like about you, Radish. You just get me. They're heading for the gauntlet! The gauntlet? The gauntlet! Now, hold that thought. Huh? What gives? Uh, hello? Hello, Pei-Pei? Pei-Pei, you out there? Uh… The door seems to be stuck. I gotta get out there and save the day. Yes, yes, you're very hungry. Pei-Pei! I get it. It'll be ready soon. I'll kick it open. Stand firm. No one can beat our defenses. Give up now. You're not getting the gauntlet. Not what we planned. Let me at 'em! I will take 'em all down, I will! I'll cook 'em up on a spit till they spitter sputter spit! Veruca! Right. Ready. The Dragon Master is here! Oh no. Whoa! Hold it. Huh? He's got the gauntlet. Oh no! Everyone, get back. Pity there's no time for that, you little weasels. We're weasels. Right. The Dragon Master is here! Look! The Dragon Master. He'll save our village. We love you! Whoa! Good news. I saved the… …gauntlet. Nice work, Pandy. Hey! Whoa. Give me that. What? You gotta be kidding me. There's one more of 'em. I got this. Hold up. Stop. Stop! Seriously, stop, you guys. I'm, like… It's been a while. Oh, your buddies leaving without you, huh? Mm, okay. A little challenging. Huh? Oh, ow. No! Oh no you don't! Whoa! Gotcha! What? How did he catch up? Aerodynamics, baby! Yes! Surrender the gauntlet, panda, before I set Veruca loose on you. I'll tear him into little pieces. Little tweety birds. Veruca! Right. The gauntlet! Give me that gauntlet. Whoa! Do pandas swim? Of course, pandas can-- Here's an idea, my little pandy-wandy friend. Let us give you a hand. Oh, that'd be swell. Just not with that hand. Farewell, fuzzy friend. Hey. Let the Dragon Master give you a hand with that. No thanks, panda. Hey, I can, I can help you with that. We don't need any more of your help. I'm the Dragon Master. I was just trying to-- Destroy our village? You're a master at that. And the WuGao Gauntlet is gone. Because of you. That was our thing! Just leave it. Maybe you want to-- Have a little snack? Yeah, good idea. Let everybody calm down. Leave. Leave? Leave. Leave. Leave. \"Leave\" leave? Look around you. You're not the Dragon Master anymore. Okay. Well, I guess I'll just, uh… Leave. Oh. Hm? Oh, Po! Quick, come on in. My poor boy. Thanks. I could really use a-- A hug? Yeah, and a bowl of noodles. Got that too. Po, everyone's talking. Oh, things are crazy. The news, the news! That I accidentally, not my fault, destroyed a village, and lost an all-powerful sacred and historical object, not my fault, that three bad guys got away with, kinda-my-fault-but-a-little-not-my-fault? Uh-huh. And I'm afraid the Emperor… The Emperor has taken away your title of Dragon Master. No! And, maybe worse, the dumpling shop returned this box of Dragon Master Happy Lunch toys. No! Uh, Po… A-Are you expecting company? It's that bear! That's one of the bandits that stole the WuGao Gauntlet. Why are they coming here? What do I do? I gotta do something! You got a lot of nerve and whatnot, coming here. Whoa. That's a lot of whatnot. Let's do this. Ha! Ow! You stay away from my Po. Whoa! Okay, okay, you win. Don't kill me. I haven't written a will or anything, and I'd hate to have my action figure collection go to the wrong person. I'm not here to kill you. You're a girl? I'm a knight. Yeah, I mean, that's what I… Different spelling, I guess. \"Knight.\" I'm looking for the Dragon Master. I was told he lives in that house. Yeah, not sure the Dragon Master still exists, but, uh, a couple of days ago, that would be me. You? You're the Dragon Master? The very idiot that leveled that village. I was just there to eat Pei-Pei's fat gobs. And you let Klaus and Veruca get away with the gauntlet. So I've heard. I thought you'd be all happy your friends got away. They are not friends. I'm chasing them. I'm trying to stop them. What? My name is Luthera of Landreth, the Wandering Blade, Daughter of the Saxon Guard, Knight of England. And you? I'm Po. That's about all I got right now. Title pending, so… By order of the Queen, I am in pursuit of Klaus and Veruca DuMont. Highly dangerous criminals. They escaped London, and are in China to locate the very weapon you let them take. Accidentally. Making them extremely powerful. It could lead to a devastating result for England, China, and the world. They must be stopped. Whoa, this sounds insanely cool. I'm in. In what? In this, with you. I'll come with you. I'd rather slice your guts out, use them to string a violin, and play it at your funeral. Okay, little harsh. Uh… You got insult game, I'll give you that, leather-shoulder-pad girl. Knight. Knight. But seriously, I'd be awesome help. Me, possibly former Dragon Master, helping a knight from England track down and capture super bad guys? And returning the gauntlet would be a perfect way for me to save face, earn trust, and regain my title. Uh, yeah, uh, help England. Whatever that is. I'll admit, I haven't made it to a foreign land yet. Just between us, I get a little seasick. Once, I threw up just looking at a cork in a birdbath. True story. So, yeah? I work alone. Cool. Me too. We can work alone together. I can help you. I'm the last person who saw Kevin and Valerie. Klaus and Veruca. I know which way they headed and how to get there. And I have this. The WuGao Gauntlet… thumb. Let me see that. Me got something you wants. Me got. You want. I'll just be keeping this in a safe place. In… a… safe… place. Come on now! That safe place being my thumb. Look, I left 'em at the Kai Yu River Pass. Take me, and I'll show you. I'd rather chop off your furry feet and use them as earmuffs while I sink you into a frozen lake. These are all so complicated and, uh, violent. Okay, Wandering Blade. Keep on wandering. 'Cause that's what you'll be doing. China's a pretty big place. Most of it, anyway. Toodles. Hold on. Yes? I'll make camp by the elm tree. I leave in the morning. Woohoo! Yes! Ah… Going on an adventure Gonna catch me some bad guys Gonna get my title back And earn me some trust 'Cause I'm sort of still The Dragon Master Is it morning? No. Is it morning? No. Is it morning? Yes! See ya, Dad. Gonna save China and stuff, and restore my reputation. Okay, son. Have fun! Yes, yes, yes! No, no, no! She's gone! Luther of Lingo, the Daughter of Wangland, something something, is gone! No! What's wrong, Po? I lost something!

Events of unimaginable scale… and violent beauty… that connect all living things… …their every action and decision, their every heartbeat, to the grandest story ever told. This is a tale 13.8 billion years in the making… that has seen billions of stars and billions of worlds… live and die… to create the only planet we know of that is home to life. From the stardust that built us… to the cosmic ingredients that sustain us… and the starlight that powers it all, this is the story of our universe. East Africa. It's where life's most vital connection to the universe can be found. And a very special predator… named Wa Chini. Life for a cheetah is a never-ending search for food… for vital energy. And this is one of the hardest places on Earth for a predator to obtain it. The blistering sun has driven away nearly everything from these dry, desolate plains. Any creature that remains here struggles to survive. Wa Chini's sole focus… …the only thing driving her… …is hunger. This simple, primal impulse stems from a deep connection she has to her surroundings that extends beyond the Serengeti, beyond our planet to the universe itself. Every cell in Wa Chini's body… is linked to an ancient stream of energy… …connecting her life to the heart of a star. This unbroken stream spans vast reaches of space… and stretches back 13.8 billion years. Ancient energy that existed at the origin of our universe powers everything. Every planet. Every star. Every life. Wa Chini is hunting for energy… but not just for herself. A mother of two five-month-old cubs, she's desperate to feed her hungry family. It's dry season, and food is scarce. And yet, energy is more abundant than ever. It's just hiding in plain sight. The largest, brightest, hottest object in our solar system… the sun. Huge loops of searingly hot plasma erupt from its surface. Our sun blasts out the energy of four and a half trillion atomic bombs every second… sending more power to our planet in an hour than the entire world consumes in a year. But as impressive as this gigantic fireball is… Wa Chini cannot eat sunlight. She only eats things that run… like gazelle. Her spotted coat provides camouflage, essential for stalking prey. With few places to hide, getting closer isn't an option. Luckily, Wa Chini has a trick up her sleeve. Cheetah are the fastest animals on land. From zero to a hundred in just three seconds… but gazelles are a pretty close second. Wa Chini uses up a lot of energy… but gains nothing. An adult cheetah can survive for over a week without a meal. But cubs, they can go no longer than a few days. And these two are getting very, very hungry. Hunting at such great speeds is incredibly depleting. Wa Chini's energy reserves are now dangerously low. It will be hours before she has the strength to hunt again. Wa Chini and her cubs are running on empty. Animals all over the planet fight the same ongoing battle between consuming… and using energy. No matter your strategy, be it fast or slow, your next meal is never guaranteed. Hunger is something all of us must overcome. Having recovered from her last chase, Wa Chini is looking for her next opportunity. Like all cheetah mothers, she's parenting solo. To keep her young cubs well-fed, she should make a kill every day. But it's taken her so long to recover that the sun is now setting. As the light fades, so does this family's hopes of a meal. As Earth rotates… the Serengeti turns away from the sun and into darkness. It's a powerful reminder of life's connection to the sun. Our story is the sun's story. Long, long ago… …our solar system was even colder and darker than it is today. And yet, these were the perfect conditions for the birth of a star. At temperatures close to absolute zero, the force of gravity began pulling dust and gas together… …into a massive cloud. The cloud collapsed inwards, crushing itself into a glowing hot ball of gas. A protostar. Like Wa Chini, this star in the making had a ferocious hunger… pulling in so much gas that jets of hot matter were propelled from its poles, stretching out light years into space. The infant star continued to grow for 30 million years… …until finally, it became hot enough to generate power all on its own. Our sun. Its golden rays have now shone brilliantly and steadily… for 4.6 billion years. It's just one star in a galaxy of billions. And yet, it is a most special one… because it is the one that delivers heat and light… to this incredible, vibrant planet. Every living thing in the Serengeti depends on the sun for its energy. Wa Chini's cubs are drained, beyond hungry now. They need to eat today. But all Wa Chini can provide this morning is precious TLC. In this parched land, our sun both gives and takes. Its fierce energy is what life needs. But it also has the power to destroy. It was never going to be easy living this close to a giant nuclear reactor. To understand the source of this unbearable heat, we must peer into the inferno… …beneath the outer layers of bubbling hot plasma… 650 thousand kilometers down… to the core of our sun. Our star's heart would seem surprisingly calm… but on an atomic level, it's pure chaos. This is the hottest part of our solar system. Temperatures here reach 15 million degrees Celsius… creating the conditions for an event that can happen almost nowhere else. Atoms collide at high speed and fuse… …releasing pure energy. This process is called nuclear fusion and is what makes our sun shine. In fact, it's what powers all the stars in our universe. This energy released by stars can be traced back to the beginning of time… when there was no matter, and all that existed in the entire universe was energy. And every bit of it lives on in our universe today. As sunlight hits the Serengeti, energy that's been flowing for 13.8 billion years finds its way to Wa Chini and her cubs and continues its journey through their environment. It is never created or destroyed. It is simply transformed endlessly. But Wa Chini and her Cubs can only access this energy in one form… meat. And there are rival predators out here… who could snatch not just her food but her cubs as well. If they don't feed soon, they will die regardless. It's a meager snack, but after two days without food, it's a lifesaver. But more than 10% of cheetah kills are stolen. Wa Chini must defend every scrap of energy she captures… …because when energy is scarce, competition is fierce. Wa Chini's struggle to survive and sustain her family is repeated day after day… …month after month. Every meal is a fight. In the battle between using and acquiring energy… Wa Chini is only just breaking even. Dry season on the Serengeti is defined by constant hunger. But change is in the air. The sun's heat has pulled what moisture there is high into the sky. And what goes up must eventually come down. Rains sweep across the plains and bring dry season to an end. As the clouds clear, a glimmer of hope appears. A single blade of grass cannot feed Wa Chini's family… but deep within its cells lies the answer to their hunger. Here, there's a hidden world. Microscopic stacks called grana bask in the warm rays from the sun. Their surface is covered with a forest of tiny, light-harvesting proteins that capture energy from our nearest star. They're packed with the green pigment chlorophyll, which absorbs rays of light. Through the magic of photosynthesis… water combines with carbon dioxide… and sunbeams are spun into sugar. In a matter of days, the once parched plains are painted green. Billions of blades of grass now soak up the boundless sunlight. And the universe's energy becomes embedded in the landscape. There's only one problem. Cheetahs can't eat grass. But far away in the northern woodlands, there are beasts… that do. Hundreds of thousands of them. Wildebeest. They have wide mouths, flexible lips, and four stomachs that are perfectly adapted to eating grass. The massive herds are constantly on the move in search of fresh grazing. To find the grass, they follow the rain. Driven, like all of us… by hunger. But if there is one rule in the Serengeti, it's that food never comes easy. The Mara River… home to some of the largest crocodiles on Earth. It's a serious roadblock in the wildebeests' quest for vital energy. To the south, Wa Chini spends every available moment scouring the plains for something edible. After six months surviving on a meager diet, one of her cubs has managed to grow bigger… …and is even learning some hunting skills of her own. But the other cub is nowhere to be seen. Just five percent of cheetah cubs make it into adulthood. Most lose their lives to hungry lions and hyenas. This cub's future is far from guaranteed… even when energy is tantalizingly close. Amassed on the banks of the Mara, the wildebeest have nowhere to go but forward. But someone needs to be first. One and a half million wildebeest make this journey each year. And here, the battle between using and consuming energy… plays out on an epic scale. For those lucky enough to make it across, this is only the beginning. Now, they must travel hundreds of kilometers day and night for over two months… to get to the grassy plains. Wa Chini eagerly awaits the arrival of the wildebeest, but there is another migration taking place that is critical to the survival of both animals. It's the journey of unfathomable distance and time. And without it, every creature on the Serengeti would go hungry. In the core of our sun, as atoms collide and fuse, photons are released and stream outwards. These tiny packages of light energy have zero mass and travel at the speed of light. But inside the unbelievably dense core, they're restrained, absorbed, scattered. A trip that would normally take just two seconds can take a million years. It's a mind-boggling torturous struggle to escape the sun. But slowly, the photons do rise upward through the sun's layers toward its raging hot surface… where they can finally be set free. They radiate out in all directions… as starlight… traveling 150 million kilometers in just over eight minutes. Arriving just in time… to meet the wildebeest at the end of their journey. Each individual blade of grass absorbs ten quadrillion photons every second… capturing enough energy overall to feed these massive herds. From star… …to grass… to wildebeest… sunlight now provides them with power to move… to grow… to reproduce. And the longer they're out on the plains eating, the longer they're available to be eaten. Rich, delicious, plentiful energy is finally within striking distance. But with three million eyes watching… Wa Chini needs to move fast. Luckily, she's a cheetah. At last, Wa Chini gets a taste of starlight. With every bite, proteins and fats imbued with cosmic energy enter Wa Chini's bloodstream. Their final destination are her body's cellular power plants, mitochondria… where one last transformation will take place. Within each mitochondrion is a surging landscape. Canyons of membranes rippling with complex chemistry. It's here that the energy-rich food reacts with oxygen and is finally broken down… releasing our universe's energy directly into Wa Chini's cells… …powering every action and thought, every little movement. The journey from star to cell is complete. Energy that once lit up the universe now gives Wa Chini and her cub the gift of life. In green season, hunger is just a memory. Across the Serengeti, energy is continually transformed… passing from one life to another, nourishing the entire ecosystem. Our sun is the ultimate provider. Everything feeds on starlight. The trouble is, there's nothing to feed the sun. And in five billion years, it will run out of fuel. As its core collapses, the sun will expand… and become a red giant… that will devour the inner planets, Mercury and Venus. As it balloons out toward Earth, the extreme gravity will rip our moon to shreds… …leaving a ring of moon rock around Earth. The ultimate fate of our planet is unknown. But there will be one last sunrise… before our star's outer layers blow away, and it takes its final breath. All that will remain is a dying ember, a white dwarf, barely the size of our Earth, surrounded by a vast glowing cloud. A beacon to the universe. We were here. But right now, our star continues to shine down on us… …and will for billions of years to come, its energy a vital force for all life. Next in the story of our universe, whether you are a blazing star… a vast black hole, or a chimpanzee learning the ropes, everything needs time. But what do you really know about this mysterious dimension? Why does everything have a past, present, and future? And would any of us be here… without time?","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-PG","Word Count":2231,"Year

Tayo! Huh? Hi, Duri. Good morning. What's up with you today? Tayo, can you help me? Huh? Help you with what? It's the last day of my summer break and I haven't done any homework yet. I need to finish everything today and I need your help. I'm sorry but I'm on my way to work now. Oh, what should I do? Hi, guys. What are you doing? Hello, Rogi. Oh. Huh? Hey, Rogi! Isn't this your day off? Yes. Ah, I wonder what fun things I should do. Oh, that's good. Do you think you can help Duri today? On what? I need to finish my homework today. I bet he can finish it quickly if smart Rogi helps out. Right? Yes! Oh? Of course. Leave that to this awesome Mr. Rogi. Really? Sure! Just some kindergarten homework. Should be a piece of cake. I was just getting bored anyway. Get on, Duri. Okay! See you. Let's go. Bye. Duri, what do you have to do? Oh, there are four different things. Collecting bugs, being nice, observing constellations. And lastly, taking a picture of something I love. What? There are four things to do? Do you think that's too much? No. Don't worry, don't worry. You've got Rogi on your side. Then what should we start with first? Mm. How about we start with the bug collecting? Here we are. Wow, where are we? There are a lot of bugs in the countryside. You should be able to find anything you want. You're great, Rogi. Thanks. Don't mention it. Do you think I may be lucky enough to find a beetle? A beetle? What is that? It's a very big bug that looks like a rhino! A rhino? Mm-hmm. Wow. But I don't think it will be easy to catch. Don't worry! Once we find it, I'll block it so that you can catch it at once. All right! Hmm. Let's see?Huh? What's that? Whoa! I found it. It's a beetle. One, two? No! Wait. Stay there! Oh! It's cold! Oh? -Huh? A beetle. Shh. Hold still. Ah! Ah! Ow. Ow. It hurts. Oh. It flew away. Rogi, why did you sneeze? We missed it because of you! What? Why is that because of me? You should have tried to hold it in even if you felt like sneezing. You scared it and it flew away. What? Tayo wouldn't have let it out like that. Hmph. I'll just go back now. Hmph! All right then. Hmph. Hmph. Huh? Oh. Don't do that. Stop! What are you talking about? Ugh, you keep tickling me! Me? Huh? What! It's a beetle! The beetle is inside! Huh? There! Huh? Where did it go? Ow! My butt! It's near my butt! What? Your butt. Oh! I've got it! Huh? It's not here. Duri, it's at the front! There it is! Yay! I got it. Really? Look at this! It's the beetle from earlier. Wow! It's so big! It is. Great! Good job, Duri. Oh, uh? -Um? Um, Rogi. I'm sorry I was angry earlier. Mm, don't be. I'm sorry. Shall we get going and work on your next homework then? Great! Tayo the Little Bus. How about we try to do something nice to someone? Then we should find somebody who needs help. Hmm, let's see. Hmm. Oh. Maybe that old lady might need our help? Huh? Ma'am. Hmm? Your bag looks heavy. I can help you carry it. What a nice kid you are. But don't worry. This isn't heavy at all. Wait. Tsk, tsk. You've got something on your face. What? Hmm. Come here for a second. There, it's better now. Thank you. Huh? No. You're supposed to be the one helping. Oh, right. Huh? Wait, why do I only have one bag? Oh, no. I must have left it at the bus I was on. Your bag? What bus was it? Let me see. I just got off at this station here. Was it a yellow one? A yellow bus. Lani? She wouldn't be too far away if she just got off. Ma'am, just wait here. Okay. Ah! Mm? The old lady waits for Duri and Rogi. Ma'am! Huh? Isn't this your bag? Oh, my. Yes, it is. How nice you are. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Goodbye. Have a good day! Goodbye. Have a good day! All right. Goodbye. Wait. Did we just do something nice? I think we did. So the next one is? -Observing the constellations, right? Yes! Mm-hmm. Now let's wait until the stars become visible. Yes! Rogi and Duri wait for night. It's dark already but I can't see any stars. What should we do? Hmm. Oh, right! We can go there. Oh? Where? You'll see. Get on. Huh? Okay. Huh? This is your garage. Hmm. I can't see them very well here either. Wait right here for a moment, Duri. Yippee! Huh? Rogi, where are you going? Rogi? Huh? Ah! What? All the lights are off. Duri. Rogi, Hana. What's going on? I'm scared. Duri, look up at the sky. The sky? Ooh, whoa! Wow! That's awesome! That is Scorpio, And that over there is Sagittarius. Wow. You can see stars better in dark places. Rogi asked to turn off all the lights at the garage for you. Did you? Rogi, thank you so much. Well, it's nothing really. Whoa! A shooting star. Really? Where? Over there, look! Wow, that's pretty. Oh, really? You finished all your homework? Mm-hmm. Look. All thanks to Rogi, I could finish them all. You are pretty good, Rogi. Right. Well, I am pretty awesome. Oh! Don't you have one more piece of homework that you have to do? You need to go and take a picture of something that you like. Oh, right. What? But isn't it kind of late to go now? It's all right. What I love is here already. Huh? What do you mean by that? What I love most of all is you guys right here. All set. Come on, Duri. Okay. Cheese! It is the first day of class. Really? You finished all your homework? Of course! I even caught a beetle. I was too busy playing around, I couldn't finish all of it. Right. Picture diary is especially hard to finish. Right, right. Hmm. Wait? Picture diary? No! Picture diary! I completely forgot about it! Oh, no. Duri eventually missed one of his homework projects. You'd better work on your homework early. \"We Are All Friends.\" Another busy day starts. Kinder is working hard from early morning. Here we are! Oh. Thank you, Kinder. You are welcome. Now I gotta head to school myself. That's right. You go to school too. How is the school for cars? Did you make a lot of friends? I'm still not very used to the place 'cause I'm new. And I don't have many friends either. Don't worry. Everyone will love to have a friend like you with your nice smile. I hope so. Everyone. We will be learning about shapes today. Which one of these has the same shape as a tire? Hmm, they all look similar. Whoa, I dunno. Who would like to answer first? Oh? Kinder, do you know the answer? Me? Uh? What should I do? I don't know. Kinder, I think the answer is the doughnut. Oh? Aha! Ms. Teach! The answer is doughnut! That's correct. You are very good. It is recess. Tayo, thanks about earlier. Oh, well, it's nothing. If you have something you don't know, just ask away anytime. Really? Um, speaking of which, I want to become friends with everyone quickly. But I'm not sure how. Oh, don't worry about that. I'll give you a special lesson on how I became so popular. Guys! Tayo! Want me to show you something funny? What is it? Monkey's fart is? Tiger fart is? Elephant fart is? - That's so funny. Wow! See? Now, show us something funny, Kinder. Me? Hmm. What should I show them? Oh! Guys, I'll show you something funny! I play music when I go backwards. Oh, right. When will you show us the funny stuff? Huh? Oh, no. This was supposed to be the funny thing. I gotta do something. Just like Tayo did. Huh? That is so funny! What is he doing? Wow! I acted like Tayo did, and everyone loved it! He'd better be a bit more careful. That's not nice. It is PE class now. Here it goes. Now, how is that? That was great, Tayo! You were great! Wow, Tayo is good at sports too. See? Kids love a friend who is really, really athletic. Give it your best shot! Ah, okay! All right! I will perform as nicely as Tayo did! All right, here goes. Leave it to me. You won't get it that easily! I've got it! Take it, Iracha. Okay. Here I am. I did it! Wow, Kinder, you are the best! Woo-hoo! I'm glad I took Tayo's advice. Oh. Isn't he being a little aggressive? And keeping the tire only to himself as well. It was so fun earlier, right? What should we do after class, Lani? Hmm, let's see. Stop right there. Catch me if you can. That wasn't very nice. Oh, no. Oh! Ah? -Huh? Oh, that scared me. Speed. Shine. Hey, what's up? Huh? You shouldn't run so fast in a classroom! That's dangerous! Oh, no. Oh, gee, sorry. I didn't know. Nuri, are you okay? Yes. Thank you, Tayo. Hmm. Wow. Tayo, you were like a superhero! Sometimes it's necessary to say \"no means no,\" even to your friends! Okay! I'll remember that! All classes for the car school are now over. Huh? What's that sound? Stop right there! Don't follow me! That's?Whoa. Rogi! Just wait till I catch you. Huh? Stop! Is he bullying her? Sometimes it's necessary to say \"no means no,\" even to your friends! All right! Wait! Huh? What's wrong? Huh? Don't bully her like that! Heart doesn't like it! Huh? Watch it from now on! We were just playing tag. What did I do wrong? I can't believe I shouted at Rogi. But I still helped a friend in trouble, and I'm a little proud of it. Tayo the Little Bus. Kinder, you seem to be in a good mood? I think I've gotten a lot closer with the kids at school! Really? We knew you'd be good. That's great. Thanks. We will be singing a song with a partner today. Now find a partner to sing together. Okay! Rogi, let's sing this together! All right. We are partners too. What if everyone wants to team up with me? Heart, do you want to partner up with me? Speed! Are you really doing that? Okay. Who should I partner up with? Huh? We already have partners. We do too. Uh?Oh! Iracha, will you? Toni! Let's get to practice already. Okay. Thank you so much You're always by my side Thank you so much You're always there for me This is so weird. Why doesn't anybody want to be partners with me? What's gone wrong? I thought everyone loved me. Hey, everyone! Let's play with a ball! Okay! Let's warm up first. One, two, one, two. I'll do it like this. That's funny. What are you doing? Oh, no! He doesn't know he is kicking up a cloud of dust. Wait! Could I possibly be? Here it goes! I've got it. Come on, quickly. It's mine. Ouch! Oh, that looked dangerous. Oh! I've got it! Whoa. Okay. Here I am. Was I just like that? Huh? Why are you being so mean? What? It's dangerous like that! You're hogging the ball! I don't want to play with you anymore if you keep acting like this! What? No, they shouldn't say such things to friends. Huh? Don't bully her like that! That's right. I was just like that. I don't wanna play with you now! That's what I said! Hmph! Oh. I was just trying to be nice, and I might have made some friends uncomfortable. Why didn't I realize it sooner? It is the next day. Everyone must have been upset because of me. Huh? They're together? Are they doing okay after the argument? Hello there, guys. Hi, Kinder. Duri, wanna team up with me for the partner running today? Okay! Oh? Yesterday you guys said you wouldn't play with each other. Nah. We made up already. Yeah! How did you do that? Nothing much. I just stepped up with courage and said that I was sorry first. That's right. Step up with courage and apologize? Huh? Hmm. That's right! When Kinder arrives at school he sincerely apologizes to his friends about what he has done. Um, guys. I'm sorry about what I did. I just wanted to be funny and ended up causing you trouble. I was acting dangerously during PE and I was saying mean things. I wanted to be good friends with you all. And just ended up making it difficult for you guys. It's all right. You didn't have any bad intention. I'm grateful you actually apologized. Hmph! I'm not feeling that good about it yet! I was so surprised back then. Rogi, he is apologizing to you. Mm-hmm. I'm really sorry. I misunderstood what happened. All right! Just this once! Actually, I was already feeling better earlier. Thanks, everyone. Oh. Wow, Kinder. You've already made friends with them? See? You should be glad of doing what I told you to. What do you mean? Doing what Tayo told you to do? I just gave him some secret tips on how to become a popular car like me. No wonder. He got himself into trouble by doing what you told him to. What? Kinder, you don't have to act like somebody else to impress others. He's right. I feel good just by looking at your smile. Really? Like this? It's good to see Kinder becomes friends with them.

Today, we're gonna focus on one of my favorites. Things that are... fluorescent. Emily's Wonder Lab Stay curious and keep exploring Hey, little scientists, come on in. Hi, Miss Emily! Hello. Welcome! Now, art is pretty cool, right? Yeah! But we're not doing art today. Aw. We're doing science. Yes! Yes! I wish there were a way that we could combine the two. Ooh. Maybe there is. Today, we are gonna make our own fluorescent paint. Whoa. That's gonna be fun. Emily wants us to make fluorescent paint! Could she be any cooler? But before we start making fluorescent paint, we just have to turn off the visible light... ...and turn on... Wow! the invisible lights. Cool! Whoa! I love everything that glows, so today is my new favorite day. Like, it's a dream, but in real life! This isn't just the ground. This is the floor-escent! Follow the path on the ground to your stations and get all of your materials, then come back to the table. Let's do this! I love stuff that glows! Toys that glow, glow sticks. Neon T-shirts, signs, lights. It's like a glow party! Emily, I wonder, what kind of lights are these? Ooh, good question, Zaela. These lights that we are seeing right now are known as black lights, and they're emitting a lot of ultraviolet light. Cool! Wow. Emily, why do sunglasses say \"UV protection?\" So, \"UV\" stands for ultraviolet. It's protecting you from the ultraviolet light that comes from the sun. It's really, really energetic, but that means that it can hurt our eyes, and it can even hurt our skin. Sunscreen... Oh, yeah. ...also has UV protection. That's cool. I never knew that. I thought I know everything about science. No, Emily knows more! Hey, Emily, if UV light comes from the sun, then why don't we see it like this light? That's a very good question, Zaela. You know the colors of the rainbow? Red, orange, yellow, green, blue... Yeah. At the end, you have indigo and violet. Oh. After violet comes ultraviolet. Light that we can't really see with our eyes. So black light has ultraviolet light, but it also has a little bit of violet light. That's why we see it as kind of this purply glow. What? That's so cool. Ultraviolet? Yeah. It sounds like the name of an alien planet. It does sound like the name of an alien planet. So, fluorescents work with ultraviolet light. The invisible light. It's really, really highly energetic light. And when it hits the fluorescent paint, the fluorescent paint absorbs some of that energy and releases the rest of it with light that we can actually see with our eyes. That's cool. So cool. Cool. So to see that further, I have a ping-pong ball. Yeah. Okay, this ping-pong ball is like our ultraviolet light. And pretend that the table is like our fluorescent paint. So, the ultraviolet light comes in really fast, at the speed of light, with highly energetic particles, and some of the energy is absorbed into the table, and some of that energy is released back to us with light we can see. So when the ball bounces back up, that's the light we see with our eyes. Cool! Yeah. And one ping-pong ball is cool, but it doesn't really illustrate the entire process, because that's happening with every single atom inside our fluorescent paint. Whoa. And there are trillions and trillions of atoms inside the fluorescent paint. Trillions? Trillions? Whoa! So instead of one ball, we need tons of them. Whoa! Whoa! Science is so fun! Wow! Don't tell Emily, but I'm keeping this one. Pink is my favorite color. Yeah! When all those ping-pong balls were coming down, that was like the highly energetic rays of ultraviolet light, and when they bounced back up, that's like the spectacular parade of photons that we see as different colors of light. Whoa! That is so cool. Emily makes science fun. Ping-pong balls and glow-y stuff? Wait a minute, is this a surprise birthday party for me? So, you guys ready to make some fluorescent paint yourself? Yeah! Okay. Get your mixing bowls ready, we're gonna create three different colors of fluorescent paint. These are the insides of highlighters... Wow! ...which contain chemicals that are fluorescent. And so you want to take the color of your choice and start pouring a little bit of water over the top while you squeeze it. Look how that glows in the light. Can I combine colors? You can combine colors. Whoa! This is about experimenting. Do whatever you want. Yeah! The other thing you want to do is we're gonna do a little scoop of cornstarch, just to thicken up our paint. All right? Oh, my fingers are glowing! Your fingers are fluorescent. Cool! Oh, my gosh. Look at Nathan's face! Whoa! Your face is fluorescent. Really? Yeah! We're glowing! We're glowing! I'm glowing! I'm glowing! Ooh, this experiment makes me so happy. The messier, the better! I feel like a scientist. Oh, no! No! I put too much in. Oh, don't worry about it. Science is all about trial and error. Oh, you're right. We're gonna add more cornstarch to thicken it up. Look how much this is glowing. This is amazing. Scientists, are you ready to go paint? Yeah! Okay, take your materials and let's go over to our canvas. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Okay, guys. Wow. Look at that. It is gonna be a masterpiece. I love painting. It's all over my hands and my hair. I'm going to paint my nails green! It's awesome! Remember, art is all about exploring new boundaries. And art and science is about expressing yourself. So, put down those paintbrushes, and put your body into it. These kids are glowing in the dark They're glowing in the dark, yeah Glowing in the dark They're glowing in the dark These kids are glowing in the dark They're glowing in the dark, yeah Science is messy, and I'm all about messes. How do they do it? How do they glow? - Did they eat some magic nachos? One more. Yeah! Glowing on their skin And on their clothes I look a mess! I bet Emily knows Why those kids are glowing in the dark Glowing in the dark, yeah Glowing in the dark They're glowing in the dark Okay, little scientists, today we learned all about ultraviolet light, fluorescent paint, and all about how to combine art with science. And remember, stay curious... And keep exploring! Whoo! Emily's Wonder Lab Stay curious and keep exploring For today's at-home experiment, we are going to make our very own lava lamp using the power of density. Now, remember, all kid scientists need a grown-up's approval. So, for this one, you need a little bit of water, a glass, like this, some vegetable oil, salt, and to go with the theme of the day, we have some phosphorescent powder and a UV light, because we wanna make our lava lamp glow. So, the first thing you wanna do is fill your glass most of the way with water. And then, you wanna add your vegetable oil. So, if we watch what happens here, watch closely, because the vegetable oil is rising to the top. That's because vegetable oil is less dense than water. It's lighter than water, so it rises to the top. Now, to start our lava lamp effect, we have some salt here. Salt is heavier than water, so it's gonna wanna fall to the bottom. So when I add it here, you can see what happens. It's grabbing onto the molecules in the oil, and taking down some of that oil with it. But once it gets down to the bottom, the salt dissolves in water, and you can see the oil starts rising to the top again. And we're seeing that same effect that we had before. But we want to make it glow, right? So let's add some phosphorescent powder. And we're gonna make this glow really bright orange. Mix, mix, mix, mix. Okay, so, now, all we need is our UV light so we can see this glow in action. Whoa! Look at that, that worked so well! And the fun part about this is that you can do this again and again. And look at that, look how cool that is. That is how you make your very own glowing lava lamp.

Well, it's the one-year anniversary of losing his lookalike Theodore doll. Oh, right. Ugh! Think he'll ever get over it? Oh, I… I hope so. Hey, Theodore. How… how ya doing? I… I still feel so guilty. I… I didn't hold on to him tight enough. He… he told me he didn't like water, 'cause… 'cause he couldn't swim, but I… I took him anyway. Aaah! Oh, no! I'm gonna go now. Theodore Seville? Yes. \"Sometimes, when we go through hardships, we come out even more special.\" Oh! It's T2! Oh, T2, I'm… I'm so happy to see you! What are you doing, Theodore? I've reunited T2 with his brothers so they can catch up. Oh! They're having the best time. Look! It's… it's like they were never away from each other. Right. Yeah. Well, they're obviously enjoying themselves. Yeah! Right? Let's not interrupt them. No! What? What's wrong? Look! T2 moved! You mean he fell over? No. Why would he just fall over? Oh, well, probably just exhausted from his trip and, you know, all the excitement from the reunion. Oh, yeah. Well, maybe. Or he just fell over, 'cause he's a doll! OK. Come on. You've had a very big day. Time for bed. Here you go. Are… are you comfortable? Good. OK. Now… now, remember, I'm right here if you have a bad dream. Where… where's T2? Oh… Who? Oh, there you are! What are you doing over here? Alvin, do… do you think he moved by himself? Um, I'm gonna go with no. You might have moved him in your sleep, Theodore, and, you know, just don't remember. Or he walked there by himself. The note said he was special. Not that special. Well, you never know. OK, I'm going to leave now to go downstairs for breakfast. What's your hurry, Theodore? T2's waiting. Wouldn't want to keep T2 waiting. Look, Alvin, we have to accept that Theodore is-- He… he moved! Again! Theodore, isn't that where you left him? No, Alvin, it is not! I left him on the edge of the trunk and now he's in the middle of the trunk. I'm… I'm pretty sure T2 is alive. Simon, we have got to set up a sting operation to catch, you know, whoever is moving Theodore's stupid doll. What about my stupid doll? We need to find out who's moving him. Yeah, well, that's fine with me, because I'm going to prove to you that T2 is alive. And he's brought the other toys to life too with… with his superpowers! Are you out of your…? You know what I'll do? I'll set up a night-vision camera so we can record T2 when we're sleeping. Oh, yes! He moved again! Let's check the footage. It looks like something's blocking the camera. Huh! It looks like T2 had one of his doll friends cover the lens. That doesn't seem stupid. That seems pretty smart, if you ask me. Ugh! This doesn't make sense! It makes perfect sense. He's like Pinocchio. You know, he was gone for a while, and then he had some hardships, and then he came back to Geppetto and… and he was a real boy! OK, Theodore, I really need you to pay close attention. T2 isn't a real boy. All right? He's still a doll. I mean, cute, looks like you and all that, but, if he were real, he'd be eating and talking and-- Well, he might not be talking, but he's walking and he's getting all the other toys to walk around too. He's real! You're nuts! Loco en la cabeza. He's a doll! Simon, he's right! His doll is alive! You gotta do something! There's nothing to do, Alvin. Besides, I don't even know why you're so freaked out. It's a Theodore doll. If it were alive, we'd have more of Theodore's sweetness in the house. Simon, don't be a fool! Everybody has a dark side! Plus, this doll came to us very mysteriously. Completely out of the blue, with a note attached to it saying, \"I'm special.\" And… and we have no idea who sent it! We just know it wasn't any of us! OK, I think we can agree that was a bit of an overreaction. Yeah. Yeah. Agreed. I… I… I… I guess this toy was leaning on the first toy that fell. Who wants to play? Why are you guys screaming? We're just getting a little freaked out. Yeah, yeah, so tonight we have to find out once and for all what's going on! How? We're gonna stay up all night and see what these guys do when they think we're asleep. Alvin. Alvin, are you awake? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm… I'm awake! But… but I just heard you snoring. That wasn't me. I don't snore. Guys, will you just be quiet? The toys have to think we're asleep. Oh, I can't believe I just said that. Come on, guys, I know you can do it. Don't fall asl… Theodore, wake up. Huh? HELLO, THEODORE! I was supposed to wake Theodore. I never said you could wake him up. Yes, you did. No, I didn't. Yes, you did! Heads up! Oh! This… this is fantastic! Did you guys do this every night? Every night we fiesta as if it is our last! Where is the music? Where did they come from? They come from across the street, Señor. But they party with us every night! Arriba! Uh-oh! Intruder! Was I dreaming? It's T2! I saw it! I saw it! I know! I know! I saw it too! He's a real boy! Wait, wait… Jeanette? What… what are you doing here? Hello? Jeanette? We can see you. OK, well… let me explain. See… Well, Theodore, when you lost your doll, I… I looked everywhere. And when I finally found him, I… I hid him in my backpack, because I couldn't let you see him that way. Then what? Well… well, then, I… I did a lot of research and I found the most skilled toy maker, who, well… who could fix your doll. It took him a whole year to repair it, but when he finished, it was perfect. Almost. What do you mean, almost? The toy maker sent me a note right after T2 arrived, saying he had made a terrible mistake and begged me to correct it. Well, what's the mistake? Well, I hate to point it out, but the shoelaces are the wrong colour. So I tried to replace them, so I wouldn't have to send T2 back, but every time I tried, something would go wrong or you would come into the room. Wait, wait… shoelaces? You terrorised us over shoelaces? Well, he's a perfectionist. I guess I should have told you that I was involved, but, you see, this way it seemed so much more magical and mysterious. It's all right, Jeanette. No harm done. No harm done? Are you kidding me? I was terrified! Thank you. Oh… You're welcome. OK. Well, good night. Sleep tight. Oh! Sleep tight? Should have thought of that before you snuck into our bedroom in the middle of the night! OK, OK. Can we just go to bed? Whose is this? I don't know. I've never seen it before. I have. Good night. I thought Dave said you needed to fix this. No, Dave said it needed to get fixed. He didn't say by who. Ugh! It's too short! I wanted a carpet that could reach the door! I've said that! My apologies, sir. Hey, Bocarter! What's the deal? Halt! No, it's all right, Jeeves. He's just a harmless commoner. Commoner? What's that? Oh, well, Bocarter thinks he's special. Ah! I know I am. I just took a DNA test that proves I'm a descendant of King Henry the V, one, one, one! It's Henry the eighth, sir. Yeah, whatever. King Henry the eighth. Yeah, and I'm Abe Lincoln's grandson. The DNA test doesn't lie! Jeeves, prepare my tea and remove these urchins from the property. Everybody's special! No, they're not! You want my DNA? What for? Bocarter sent his to this company and learned he's Henry VIII's great, great, great, great, grand-nephew three times removed. I want to make sure you're special too. No, Alvin. It's ridiculous. I'll go for my run and I'm pretty sure you've got homework. Why won't Dave just give us a little, tiny, itty-bitty piece of saliva, so we can do the DNA test? Dave could be a king of some island paradise! -Making us awesome princes. - Really? Or Dave could be related to some famous astronaut and we could fly around in spaceships! Oh, boy! Or he could be the heir to a huge fortune and we could get anything we want! That would be so cool! We have got to get Dave's DNA! Are you in? I'm in! Ho, ho, ho! All we have to do now is mail it in and wait for the results. This one's heavy. What you got in here, a box of bricks? Oh, sorry about that. I ordered a new set of knives. Now? Wait for it… And… go for it! Dave! Dave! Did… did my letter arrive? Oh, what letter is that? Oh… uh… you know. I, uh, a letter from… someone. Does someone have a name? Oh! Uh… Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He… he's… he's my pen pal. And… and his name is… Oh! Pen… Pen Pal… Yeah! Oh! Oh! Here it is! Bye! So, what does it say? Are we kings? OK, let's see. \"Dear Mister, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah… We've linked you to these historical figures with the same genome sequencing… blah, blah…\" Dave's from Mister Blah Blah? Ugh! No, Theodore. We're gonna need a translator. Wait, wait, wait. You sent in Dave's DNA sample? Simon, OK, will you just put your outrage aside for a second? We just want to know if Dave owns a castle or is a ruler of some island nation. Nope. I refuse. Not interested. Nope. Oh, OK. So, let me just get this straight. You're telling me, as a scientist, you're not the least bit curious as to what these very scientific results can tell us? You'd rather stay in the dark, would you? Huh? Uh… Yeah. Yeah. Stay in the dark! And… and it's really, really dark too. Oh, gimme that. Oh… We'll show Bocarter who's king around here! So, what does it say? Oh. Um… Oh, Theodore, um, would you mind getting me a glass of water, please? Uh, OK. I didn't want him to hear this, but according to the DNA results, Dave is a direct descendant of… Jack the Ripper! Wait. Wait, Simon. Did you say Jack the rapper? Dave's actually a rapper? No, Alvin. He's not a rapper. He was a serial killer in Victorian London. Then why was he called Jack the Rapper? Ripper! The Ripper! You're missing the point! Dave's ancestor was a deranged killer! Oh, you caught… We were just having a little joke. You know, ripper, rapper… Really? 'Cause… 'cause it didn't sound like a joke. Oh! Sure it was! Dave's ancestor's a serial killer. Oh, please. Oh, that's a good one. I know! I know! Funny, right? So Dave's ancestors liked knives. I mean, big deal! That was like a thousand years ago in the Viking era. It wasn't Viking times. It was Victorian. And more like a 120 years ago. Oh, no! But, Theodore, just because one of Dave's ancestors was a bad person, you know, we know Dave isn't! Do… do we, though? Dave just ordered a new set of knives. That's right. That's right! What about the experiment where, you know, old family DNA can strike at any minute? Not remotely what I said. You know, one day, you're just you, poor, unsuspecting soul, going about your own business, mowing the lawn, and the next, bam, here comes the old family DNA turning you into a monster! Hey, guys! AAAH! Will you guys just relax? Just want to let you know dinner will be a bit early tonight, so that I can go for my run. What happened to you? Oh! Oh, this? I just cut myself sharpening the kitchen knives. Theodore, you forgot the knives. Did I? Yeah, I… I guess I did. Yeah! I mean, it's not like we need 'em, Dave. Right, you know. And, well, hard to believe that, you know, the edge of a spoon is equally effective at cutting. I'm getting the knives. We got rid of the knives. Wait. What? We got rid of them, OK? They're just… they're gone. Because they… they needed cleaning! Oh! So, you're cleaning them? Well, uh, you know… technically, Miss Miller's cleaning them. Miss Miller? Miss Miller. You know. Next door. We gave her the knives to clean, so… so they'd be out of the house! No, no, Theodore. Remember? It's because they were dirty. That's why. This is almost as good as a knife. Oh, no! It… it is? Aaah! What was that? Probably just a power surge. I saw on the news a weather front was rolling in. Gonna be lots of fog. Anyway, I'm gonna go for my run now. What do you do out there every night… when you go for a run? I… I… I run. Must be nice to run in the fog, where no one can see you. It's… it's OK. I imagine lots of stuff can happen in the fog. That no one ever sees. Right, well, look… Anyway, guys, I'll be back soon. And, Alvin, pick up your bike, please! It's just laying on the sidewalk. We have to call the police! Just hold on a minute! We can't turn Dave in. What if he's innocent? Well, then, he'll have nothing to worry about! Hello, what's your emergency? Wait. I'm sorry. What? Hurry! Well, hello, David. Hey. Hey, Miss Miller. Uh, this might sound weird, but did the boys bring my knives to your house? Well, yes, they did. David, are they OK? They were acting very strange. So I assumed you were all having family troubles. So, I made you my favourite boysenberry pie. Oh, now careful of those knives. I'll carry the pie for you, David. OK, so you think he went that way? Yes. Definitely. Well, not… not definitely. Or that way. Oh, I hate this fog. It's so hard to see. We must be careful, David. I don't want us to trip. Aaah! Let's go! Oh! Aaah! Oh… He got Miss Miller! Dave, no! Ah! Ah! Ah! Remove seal! Pepper spray! Aaah! Oh, no! Aaah! So, Dave, look, I just want to quickly apologise. I may or may not have overreacted. The boys got me all scared-- Stop talking. OK. Fair enough. Miss Miller, if you want to come with me, I'll walk you home. Dave! Dave! We've got some great news! Really? What's that? This letter just came from the DNA testing site. It seems that they mixed up the lab results. Yeah! Bocarter isn't a king any more! And you're not related to Jack the Dipper! It's Jack the Rapper, Theodore. Uh, no, Alvin. It's Jack The Ripper. But, Theodore, I already knew I wasn't. Anyway, Dave, you know, they say in the letter they'll do a test for free. No, Alvin. I'm not doing it. But, Dave, don't you see? You don't have to be boring David Seville any more! I'm not interested! But you could be related to the mother of dragons! Alvin, seriously! Just stop it! Please, reconsider! Alvin!

We know, you don't believe us. You think fairy tales are cute and pink and full of fairies. -Well, they're not. -Real fairy tales are scary. Follow two children as they venture off into a dark tale. -A scary tale. -A strange tale. -A… Wait a minute. Are you even old enough for this? -You really think you can handle it? You've been warned. Don't blame me if you can't sleep tonight. All right then, you're weird. You might as well settle in. It's time for A Tale Dark and Grimm. I don't know. So far the story is not that awesome. Come on, he hasn't even started yet. Let's dive right in, shall we? Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Grimm, there were two children… Hansel… Come out, come out, wherever you are. Gotcha! Huh. Boo! Ah! …and Gretel. You probably think you know their story. I don't think you do. Not the real story. Never heard of them. They lived with their mother, the Queen… Story time. …and their father, the King. I'm the dragon! Their parents loved them very much. They were a happy, little family. Until the dragon came. I'll protect you. Don't worry, it's only a story. When the darkness opens wide Swallowing up the sun inside - Dabbled stars, they prick the sky Blanket on which the moon will lie Which is why it was fairly surprising… …when their father cut off their heads. Whoa, whoa! You can't tell that part of the story, William. There are kids out there. I mean, look at that one over there. How old could you be? Seven? How else is he gonna learn what's inside a person's neck? It's mostly blood. We're gonna show it. Tastefully! Aha! Ha! Ha! Ah. What? Too soon? You might think that this was the end of the tale of Hansel and Gretel. -In fact, it was just the beginning. Is this really going to work? It will. It has to! And… done. So, up and at 'em. Oh. Here you go. Oh… Gretel? Hansel? Please! Oh, how could we ever have believed this would bring them back? What have we done? What? Ah! Phew. Children, you're… awake! So, who wants chocolate cake? I guess a slice would be-- No, thank you, Father. But Gretel… We're very tired, and also we don't remember what happened just now, in case you were wondering. I think we'll just go to bed. I'm not tired. Good night. Love you guys. Sleep well. It worked. It really worked. Do you think they noticed anything? Hurry, Hansel. We have to get out of here. Why would they do that? Don't they love us anymore? You don't cut off the heads of things you love. You do with flowers. We must have done something bad. Something really bad. This isn't because of us. It's them. They're awful, evil! Parents shouldn't slay their children. Not even once. I-- I shouldn't even have to say that. Hansel, we have to get out of here. But where are we gonna go? I don't know, but we'll figure it out, together. Will it be an adventure? That I can promise. And don't worry, I will always protect my little brother. No. I'll protect you. And I'm not your little brother. You're only two minutes older than me. Almost three. Do you trust me? Let's do it. Adventure! Oh, no. They're coming. Come! Quick! Rug! Now! Come on. Ah! What did you tie the other end to? Whoa. Whoa. This… is going to be fine. Who's that weirdo? Why is he wearing a cloak? This is supposed to be… …mysterious. Scared and confused, Hansel and Gretel made their way through the quiet village. Gretel, what are we gonna do? Trust me. I have a plan. We are going to find better parents, perfect parents. Like ones who won't kill us so much? Exactly. Okay, you know that woman who delivers bread to the castle? The one who always gives us chocolate cake? Mrs. Baker? I was thinking she'd make a perfect new mother. Yeah. Chocolate cake is like love. Mom and Dad used to give us chocolate cake. Do you think they still loved us then? I don't know, Hansel. Now, look… Mrs. Baker lives right here. Uh, what's this we have to go through? It says, \"deep dark woods.\" Maybe we should go back home. If we just knew why Mom and Dad did what they did, maybe-- Hansel, do you really want to get your head cut off again? Just do what I do. Take all your feelings and put them in a box. Lock and bury it and set fire to it. What? Okay. Never think about them again. How can I set fire to the box after I buried it? Hansel! We are going to find the perfect parents whatever it takes. And then… Mom and Dad will be sorry. Let's go. Stay close. Uh… Uh… And so Hansel and Gretel made their way through the deep dark woods -to find the perfect family. One of us. Who's there? I'm armed! Ah! One of us. D-did you hear that? It's-- It's just the wind. Wait! Bats! They're in my hair! Get them off me! Shoo! Get out of here. Gross. One of them kissed me! Okay, we have to find somewhere we can rest for the night. It's too dark to go on. Look. It's glowing. Whoa. This is crazy! Sewing someone's head back on should not bring them back to life. It's some kind of magic thread. Modern medicine is amazing. Gretel, I have a bad feeling about this place. Just a thought, instead of resting, we could keep walking forever and ever and please, please not stop in the deep dark woods. No. We need rest. And Hansel, I know you can keep me safe. Okay, I can do this. Yeah. All I've gotta do is keep my eyes wide open… …all night long. One of us. Wolves. Gretel? Gretel? Would you rather die awake or in your sleep? Why would you ask? In my sleep. Too late! Stay back! Stay back! Take this! I'm sorry I got us into this! If I have to die again, I'm glad it's with you. Wait, did that sound like I'm glad you're dying? I wasn't paying attention! Stay away! I'm warning you! Uh-oh. Run! That way! We gotta get across. I can't do it! I can't do it! You have to. Take my hand! Come on! Help me! Ha-ha! Oh no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ah! Bad day to be a wolf. Hmm. Wow! You two all right? Those wolves will take a piece of you if you give 'em half a chance. Here. You must be freezin'. Thank you. Thanks. Sir? We're looking for a Mrs. Baker. Oh, yeah. Yeah, her cottage is a day's walk that way. You can't miss it. Uh, are you two kids alone? I'm only asking 'cause you look like you need a place to stay. We've got plenty of room on the farm for the both of you and plenty of turnips. Hansel, a turnip farmer. Or a cake baker. We have a winner. No, thank you, sir. But we appreciate your help. Oh, that's too bad. We'll be there, if you change your minds. Yee! Thanks. Bye. See ya. Hansel and Gretel continued on unaware that they were being followed by him. A day later, Hansel and Gretel emerged from the forest exhausted and hungrier than they had ever been in their lives. Mmm! You want some turnip sack? The sweaty part is salty and good. Mm-mm-mmm! Hansel, are you seeing what I'm seeing? Is that… a cake-house? I'm going to find out. With my mouth! Yeah! Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Ha-ha! Mmm. Mmm. Children! Oh, I just love… …children! Try the fence, my widdle sugar-puffs. It's peppermint candy cane! Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom. Thank you, ma'am. I'm sorry we screamed. We thought you were gonna chop us up. Hansel! Chop you up? Why? I love children. They're so… sweet. Oh, give me a break. I know we're doing a \"Is she nice or is she evil?\" thing, but come on! Everyone knows this story. She's a witch who eats children. What's wrong with that? Children are so sweet and juicy. She's not a witch. She is a perfectly ordinary woman who eats children. You see, once she had a child of her own. And she did what parents so often do… Oh… …look at you, you are so sweet. But she took it just a little bit farther. I could just eat you right up, yes, I could. Ooh, oh, I could… just eat you up. Thus, her beloved child became several rather delicious pies. And once you've developed a taste for children… …it's a hard habit to give up. Come in, sweet ones. Come, come, come. Stay for dinner. Stay as long as you like. Stay forever. Sit. Let me bring you a little snack. You must be hungry. What brings you to my little cottage, my sweethearts? Our parents chopped our heads off. Really? How inconsiderate. Ha! We're looking for the perfect family. Or at least one that won't kill us. And will let us eat chocolate cake whenever we want. And never make us do chores. Well, I have some… …cake for you now! And just about everything you could ever desire. How's that for a happily ever after? Ma'am, may we eat like animals? You do you, baby. Hansel and Gretel had found something to replace their parents' love: food. Really just a lot of food. Eat up. Mmm. This. That. Some of this. Some of that. Eat my sweets. This is very good cake. Mmm. Yeah. She must really love us, right? Yeah. Remember when Mom and Dad played hide-and-seek with us? Do you think they still loved us then? I don't know, Hansel. We have Mrs. Baker now. Everything is fine. Here you go, my sugar plums. Eat those pies up… And get nice and plump and juicy Ya-da ba-ba-ba-ba Chubby, chubby kids Ooh! Oh, look at my sweepy widdle muffins. Come, I have a lovely room ready for you with great, soft beds. Good night, sleep tight. Don't let the bed bugs bite. Not until you're… ripe. We did it, Hansel. We found the perfect family. And she's so pretty. I love her so much. How come is the closet full of children's shoes? Eh… Kids are always losing things. That one has a foot in it. A little foot leg. Don't worry about it. It's fine. My plan worked perfect and everything's fine. If you say so. Good night. Wakey wakey. Foody-oot. Food, food. Nom nom nom nom. Yay! Food! Mmm. Yes. Eat up, little piggies, eat up! Those ham hocks ain't gonna fatten themselves. Digesting so much food took a lot of energy. After a while this left very little energy for Hansel and Gretel's brains. That was when Mrs. Baker decided… -…they were ripe. Oh, Hansel. Is that you, food? I need your help in the kitchen, honey pie. Okay. There's food there, right? Uh-huh. Yeah. Be a lamb and get in the oven and tell me when it's hot enough to bake you and your sister, will you? There's a widdle boofy-woops. How will I know when it's hot enough? You'll die. Oh. Hey. Yes? If I'm dead, how will I tell you it's hot enough? I'll smell you cooking. M'kay. Whew, boy, whew. Wow. Something smells delicious. Huh. It's me that smells delicious. Oh, it's just you, pocket pork chop. Wait a second. Dying is bad! No! Hot, hot, hot, hot! Ow! How are you doing in there, my widdle dumpwing? Uh-- Uh, just fine. Nearly dead now. I don't smell you yet! Hansel hardly had any brainpower left. But he had just enough to trick Mrs. Baker into opening the oven door. There it is. My dear little piggie. Oink, oink. Huh? Heads up! Ha! Get baked! No! No! You ungrateful little swine! Gretel, wake up! We have to go! Food? She tried to cook me! We have to go! Wait. What's going on? Oven… doors… don't… lock! Sweeties! Hansel? Hansel! Do you really want to know when your parents stopped loving you? The answer is quite simple. Obvious, really. They never loved you. Never. Never. Never. You know it's true. Ah! Ha-ha! Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom! Eat this! Oh! Agh! Whoa! Agh! Um, maybe she's okay? Uh… Maybe she's okay. Oh, she is not okay. Mmm. Candy canes never looked so good. Would you please just… Forget it. Can we just check in on the children who are watching this right now? Are you guys all okay out there? How about that little kid? You. You're still here? A woman just got impaled on a peppermint stick. Why would he not leave? I give up. I like that kid. And so Hansel and Gretel got far away from that place as quickly as they could. It's true, isn't it? Mom and Dad never loved us. But that means we did the right thing. We just didn't pick the right parent. That's the reason my plan didn't work. We need someone more down to earth. Like that farmer! Nothing's more down to earth than turnips. We can do this. We can find a better family. A perfect family. Are you with me? We're never going back. It's you and me forever. Hello. We meet again. Unfortunately. Two children were here, two unusual children. They are mine. Oh, you can have them, for now. That's not what I'm here for. Oh, yes, you should carry on. Ta-ta. Have a fantabulous trip. Um, hello? H-- Hello? So, wait. What's going on here? Nothing good. Me? Wait, no. But I'm-- But I'm not ripe yet. No. But you are done. Ha. Ooh! Nailed it. Under a sunny sky, Hansel and Gretel arrived at the turnip farm. That farmer seemed like a no-nonsense guy.

This is Reporter Geoffrey bringing you the Lusaka News! While the sun may be shining brightly, last night another mysterious tornado struck. Its powerful winds knocked out power for hours. -Iye, Geoffrey, I know. Hey, iwe! Elo, I was busy finishing my project for the Science fair ka. Geoffrey, do you realize Mr. Magedzee is going to be there? These tricky twisters were previously unheard of in Zambia, and indeed, Africa. So why are they happening, Geoffrey? Blackouts from load shedding were bad enough. Now tornados? Likando, why did I join the majorettes? It's bad enough being the new kid at school. Ah-ah, Monde. Did you forget you were captain of your old majorette team? You've got this, little sis. These tornados are just another disaster battering Lusaka. With an increase in crime and daily blackouts, the people are calling for Mayor Sikazwe's resignation. No more blackouts! -Please! No more load shedding! Sisi, if Mayor Sikazwe gets fired, you could lose your job. Don't worry about me. I don't plan on being the mayor's assistant for long. I see much bigger and better things for us soon. Iwe Monde! Get over here now! Coming, Marjory. This is Chipo with Kamiji Secondary's very own star player of the fútbol team, Zikomo Phiri! Ah-ha! This is Zee with Kamiji Secondary School's very own Chipo Hamoonga, who is crushing on Komana Mwiinga. Stop, ekse! One vitumbuwa. Two vitumbuwa. Who am I kidding? Thank you, Ba Saasa! Hey! Huh? Temwe Chiti! Are you stealing food? Principal Nkwashi, what do you take me for? A delinquent? Hm. I've got my eye on you, Chiti. What's the other eye doing? Hm. Lusaka hasn't endured this kind of turmoil in 20 years. Who can keep our city safe? Mama K's Juice Ya Cheapa! T.O.M.I., come online please. T.O.M.I. here, Mama K. The threat is growing, T.O.M.I. We need our new team today to keep our people safe! Commencing final footage collection to confirm our candidates. ]dramatic music playing] Mama K! Oh! Are you all set up? Oh, yes, Mr. Nkwashi, thank you. Um, if you don't mind, I may need to speak to you later about volunteers for my fruit and vegetable stand. Volunteers? Anything to help a member of our little community. Hello, everybody! Hello, bantu banga. I am Lee Magedzee, owner of Magedzee Power Corporation. Thank you for inviting me to Kamiji Secondary School's Science Fair. At MPC, we are committed to bringing power to the people! I am beyond excited to see your inventions and discover if one of you will be the next recipient of our MPC scholarship! The power to save our world starts with you students. Yes! Mr. Magedzee! I am Komana Mwiinga. I would like to apply for the MPC Scholarship. So nice to meet you. May I present to you my Carbon Capture machine. Very intriguing. I'm all ears. Well, the concept is based on-- Huh? Another power station attack. And the tornado is headed here. T.O.M.I., focus on the tornado. We need to know what is really going on. - Yes, Mama K. Attention! Take shelter under the stands! Follow me! Help! Somebody! I'm trapped. Help! Hey! Help Mr. Nkwashi. Huh? Help me, please! But Ba Saasa! And the vitumbuwa! Help! Help! I've got them! May I use this, Gogo? Ba Saasa, use this! Help! Hm. Mr. Nkwashi, pull yourself to safety. Don't tell me what to do, Chiti! But I'm trying to help you! Hm. I should have saved the vitumbuwa. Help! Help! Help! Let's go, Marjory. Eh! Let's go who? Let's go, Captain. I've got you, Chipo! Run! Hmm. Gogo, run! A freak tornado ran through the city, striking another power station and wreaking havoc on Kamiji Secondary School. -Tensions in Lusaka are rising… …with endemic blackouts bringing life to a standstill, and repeated… Komana. Here you go, Ta. Use this. Catch your breath. Are you okay now? Yes. Thank you. Mr. Nkwashi just called. You are required to attend a meeting. Are you in trouble? Huh? What? No. Wait. When is this meeting? Mr. Magedzee is giving me another chance to present my Carbon Capture machine. At his office in just a few hours! Mr. Nkwashi said, \"Right now.\" And gave me an address. Hm? It's not at school. Where is this? Huh! So I guess I'm not the only one with detention. Yeah, you have the wrong girl. Me? Detention? Aweh. We don't mix. Me neither. I just moved here. Oh. Hi. I'm Monde. Hey. Zee. If we're not serving detention, why did Mr. Nkwashi send us here? Because I asked him to. Oh! The Juice Ya Cheapa lady. Muli bwanji, girls. Bwino bwanji, Gogo. I am Mama K. This is Chomps. And you have arrived at my fruit and vegetable stand. You four have been offered this great opportunity to give back to your community. Opportunity for free labor, ka. Shh. You will save the world working here. Eh? Here? Mm, Gogo. I have an important appointment this afternoon. From what time to what time are we saving the world? Right now. But not right here. Come with me. What's that story with the old lady luring kids with sweets? She's like a little old gogo, ha. Totally harmless. Little old gogo? Hmm. That's how people disappear. Follow me, please. Mama weh. We are going to disappear. As you know, girls, mysterious tornados have been causing destruction across Lusaka. But there is more to it than meets the eye. Abeg. You're one of those conspiracy theorists with an underground bunker. This is where you are going to save the world. What? Are you serious? Ati, what? So cool. What? Huh? Wait, does Mr. Nkwashi know about this? No. He just thinks you're volunteering at the stand above. This is my little secret. What is this place? Many years ago, I was part of a secret government agency, working in these very headquarters, fighting evil forces in our city. Sha! This gogo is lekker. Eh, eh, eh. Did you just say evil forces? Evil how? As I was saying, things are not what they seem. T.O.M.I., pull up drone footage from yesterday. Pulling up footage. - Artificial intelligence. Artificial boyfriend. Ah. Technological Operations Management Interface. T.O.M.I. T.O.M.I., zoom in, please. Zooming in. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that a guy caught in the tornado? He's not caught in it. Basa, he's controlling it. Yes! The tornados are not a freak act of Mother Nature. They are an act of a supervillain. Supervillain? Wait, wait, wait! How? Why? I'm not sure yet. We need to find out and put a stop to him. We? Did you just say \"we\"? She just said \"we.\" Mm. That's what she said. We. I have been observing you keenly for weeks. Observing us? You mean like, stalking? It's called gathering intelligence. And based on what I've gathered, it is clear that you are the elite super squad I need to help save Lusaka. Huh? You mean, superheroes! Huh? Huh? Uh, yeah. Okay. Superheroes. And based on my astute observations, I have built super suits distinctive to each of you. What? This is so… They've been designed to boost each of your natural abilities. They'll keep you safe and protect your identity. All this talk about a suit. So what's with the watch? Huh? Can I get a \"whoa\"? Whoa. Oh! Sorry, Chomps! Oh, it happens. Now, girls, it is extremely important that you keep your secret identities secret. No one can know. Not your sister. Not your father. Not your bestie friend. Not your vitumbuwa vendor. You know about Ba Saasa? It is for their protection as much as yours. Yeah. Okay. It has been 20 years since Lusaka needed a team of heroes. If we want our people to survive, they need a team they can depend on. But why us, Mama K? It's not every day a 60-year-old lady sees four young women running into danger, shwi! Without thinking of themselves. But being a hero takes more than super strength suits and high-tech gear. It takes character. Together, you possess the innate qualities this team requires. Komana, K-Bongo, the lover of knowledge. Zee, Za-Mpezi, fast like lightning. Monde, M-Kozo, the bringer of peace. And Temwe, T-Mlilo, full of fire. Aww! I wanted to be T-Licious. Huh? But T-Mlilo is awesome. Fiyah! The mind, body, soul, and heart of our team. Together, you are my Team 4. Okay! So, is Team 4 ready to save Lusaka? Ya, ya, ya! Yes, Mama K. Yes. Mm. Yeah! T-Mlilo in the byu byu! Eh, byu byu? As in, building? Eya boom! You got it, Mama K. Za-Mpezi in the byu byu. Me too! M-Kozo in the byu byu! My appointment! I'm going to be late. K-Bongo, wait! Are you in… The byu byu? No. What? I need to get that scholarship from Mr. Magedzee. Mama K, I'm sorry. Wait, ba jobee, you are leaving all these nice, nice things for the ka scholarship? My entire future depends on it. And my dad. He's sick. This is not how I'm going to save the world. I can't… I can't do it all. But-- Ah, ah. Let her go. The water may be boiling on the stove, but no one can force you to pour in the mealie meal. You have to be hungry. So, T-Mlilo's Team 3! How does everyone feel about that? Ah! What is happening, T.O.M.I.? Oh, oh, oh… Oh ,no! Girls, it's Go Go time! Thank you for letting me present my project to you. Of course, Komana. We can't let a tornado get in the way of science, can we? No, sir. This is my solar-powered Carbon Capture machine. My machine doesn't just capture carbon. It uses electricity generated from solar panels to split CO2 into energized carbon monoxide and oxygen. Once carbon monoxide is released, it's combined with hydrogen to produce safe, synthetic carbon-based fuels. Uh-huh. So we can purify dangerous CO2 from the atmosphere while producing clean fuel and oxygen at the other end. It's brilliant. How did you choose solar as your power source? Well, I looked into a number of energy resources. Geothermal, wind, even an extremely rare mineral called Zambianite. Ah, yes, I've heard of that mineral. But ultimately, in Lusaka, the sun was the most reliable. Very true. And why a portable version of the Carbon Capture machine? My dad developed breathing problems from the pollution, and other people might be suffering the same way. That's what I love! Technology made to benefit the lives of others. Astounding, Komana! I am impressed! While we have a few candidates left to interview, I can tell you that you are in the top running. We'll have the final results soon. Dad! Um, Mr. Magedzee, I have to go. Thank you, sir. Thank you for… coming, Komana. Ta? Ninzi? Komana. Ta? Are you okay? I'm here, I'm here. Help! Help! Did you hear that? Look, over there! Imwe, tiyeni! Komana! I need help! Whati? Huh. Well. That's new. Ta! Komana… You know these girls? Uh… Get him in the van. I'll take him to hospital. Komana. Thank you, daughter. -Ta. You saved my dad's life. Don't worry, Komana. He's going to be fine. Mama K, I can save the world in different ways. I see that now. Is it too late to… Suit up! Yah! Bantu banga, we need to get to whoever is inside controlling this! T-Mlilo! Let's use your ribbon, like you did with Mr. Nkwashi. Great idea. Are you hurt? Just my pride. And my butt. We got him! What do we do? What is that? It's a brazier! Yah! Yah! Look at you, K-Bongo! Breaking up that tornado's cold air with a firebomb. Genius, ekse. Genius. All this trouble has been caused by some old man. Old?! Old?! I am Storm Drain. Creator of chaos! King of climate! I will not be defeated! Looks like you just were, Grandpa. I can't believe we pulled that off. Huh? Job well done! Congratulations, Team 4! Team 4 in the byu byu! The public was pleasantly surprised when a group of heroes calling themselves Team 4 finally put an end to the natural disaster that was not so natural after all. So, who are these heroes, and where do they come from? Perhaps our pleas for help have finally been answered. Be careful, Lusaka. Those pleas will soon be drowned out by my power.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-Y7","Word Count":2072,"Year

It's a Llama Llama day Time to learn and time to play Llama, Gilroy, Nelly Gnu What will best friends find to do? Don't you worry, don't you fuss Every day is fun with us Games, adventure, friendship, drama Come along and play with Llama Come along and play with Llama Come along and play with Llama Three Friends and a Baby Newman! Whoa! Wait. Let me try again. Keep watching, Mama. Go ahead. I am. Whoa! Wait! One more try. Keep watching! Whoa! There! That was better. I'll keep trying until I get it. I know you will. You're persistent. Per-sis-tent. Is that good? It is. Persistent means you never give up, and I love that about you. Thanks, Mama. Watch me try again. Ta-da! I did it perfectly! Whoop! Oh! Not giving up. Silly baby Newman. You can't eat paper! Oh! He certainly can't. Thanks, Nelly. He keeps trying to put everything in his mouth. Here, Newman. Try a banana. Why does he put a calculator in his mouth but a banana in his ear? I guess it's one of those fussy days. I might as well just give up on getting this paperwork done. Give up? But Mama, you said it's good to be persistent. That means you never give up. Babies are a lot of work, and they need a lot of looking after. What if I take care of baby Newman so you can get your work done? Nelly, how nice of you. You can be my mother's helper. I've watched you and daddy lots of times, and I bet I can even get him to calm down and stop fussing. That would be amazing. Thank you. Hi, baby Newman. I'm going to be your big sister babysitter today. We're gonna have lots of fun. Oh, are we expecting anyone? Hey. Hi, Nelly and baby Newman. We brought the hoops to practice our tricks. You remember, right? Oh, I forgot you were coming. Sorry. And I told Mama I wanted to help her with baby Newman. He's been fussy, and she has work to do. Oh, hi, kids. Nelly, you can go play. I'll take care of Newman. Or we can help you with baby Newman. If that's okay. We'll have the rest of the day to play. That's great. Thank you, Luna and Llama Llama. Oh, what's wrong, baby Newman? Maybe he doesn't like being outside? I got your nose! And we put it back. Whoops! Got your nose again! Maybe this will make him less fussy. Got your nose! And if this doesn't work, I have another plan to calm Newman down. I never give up. Nelly, you're... persistent. My mama told me that word. Did everyone but me know that word? You don't give up, Nelly. Don't worry, Mama. We're going to keep trying and not give up on settling baby Newman down. Sounds good. I'll get back to my work. Do you think it's okay to take baby Newman outside so he can watch us play? Not yet. The noise might scare him. Here's the plan. We play with him quietly so he won't get over-excited, then we feed him, but not too much, sing a quiet song to him, and then he should calm down. And then can we play? Absolutely. This'll just take a few minutes. Okay, let's do it. Peekaboo! Peekaboo! Peekaboo! Your turn, Llama Llama. We've been playing this a long time. Can we take a little peek-a-break? Is everything okay? I heard baby Newman crying. All okay, Mama. We were playing peekaboo, and he didn't wanna stop. Oh, yes, he does love that game. Okay, now we're going to feed him a snack to calm him down. You're really hungry, Newman. Okay, I think Newman has eaten enough for now! He should be calmer. You kids are doing a great job. Can I take baby Newman so you can play? It's okay, Mama, but thanks. We're following our plan. Also, Nelly never gives up. Okay! I'm very impressed. Let's wipe him up a little and get onto the singing quiet songs. Here goes our made-up lullaby. Even though it's day Be calm like it's night Nelly is trying very hard To take care of you just right He's supposed to be calm, not blowing baby bubbles. Hey, let's try this. If we're quiet, he'll be quiet. I hope. Hey! That tickles! Cut it out! Seems like he has more energy than ever. Maybe we should take him outside again. Should we just go play? Your mama will watch Newman. Yeah, we've tried everything. Everything except giving up. What do you say, Llama? Should we try it all again? Let's do it. My mama always says that the first try is just... a way to learn how to do it better. Okay, baby Newman, one more time. First, we're going to play with you, then give you a snack, then sing to you, and then... You'll be calmer... maybe? Look, Newman! A big teddy bear! Hello! I'm a bear! Let's make some music, baby Newman. He likes it! Now onto step two. Now you'll have a little drink. Not too much at all. Just some milk. He dropped it! He dropped it again. What do we do now? He keeps asking for the bottle and throwing it. Babies sure can't make up their minds. I guess we're not playing today. Oven mitts? Yes! He always calms down when I move them around like puppets. Hi! I'm Mr. Oven Mitt. And I'm Mrs. Oven Mitt. And I'm Baby Oven Mitt! Okay, new plan. We'll all rock baby Newman quietly and calmly. His eyes just closed. His eyes are open! I know I never give up, but... I give up! I'll never get Newman to calm down! I'll take him, sweetie. Don't worry. Wait, Mama. I didn't really mean it. I'm a persistent sitter. One more try, Luna and Llama Llama. Hi, everyone. And hello, baby Newman. He was really fussy just before this. You've never seen a baby this fussy before, Mama. I bet I have! When you were a baby, little Llama, you were so fussy one day, I couldn't put you down at all. I was a fussy baby? Of course. All babies are fussy from time to time, especially when they're teething. Right, Mama Gnu? Absolutely. Teething is when a baby has a tooth coming in. Oh! Of course! Baby Newman's been rubbing his cheek. Baby Newman is teething. You have a new tooth coming in, Newman. That's why you're so fussy. When babies are teething, cold things make their mouths feel better. New plan! We'll find some cold things for Newman. Then he'll feel better. Come on! Oh! We used to do this all the time when we were kids. Good job, kids. You got Newman to calm down. We did. It wasn't easy, but we didn't give up. Do you kids want your hoops back? I'm kind of tired. Me too. We'll watch for a while. Thanks for the break. Now let's see you kids do it. New Neighbors! Llama Air, flight 4321 ready for takeoff! Hi, Llama Llama. Hi, Mrs. Goat. Hey, Gilroy. You wanna play airplane with me? Can't. On my way to soccer practice. Mama, can I get my scooter and ride over to the park with Gilroy? Another time, Llama Llama. Right now, we're off to meet the new neighbors. New neighbors? Do we have to? They just moved in yesterday. We're gonna stop in on them sometime later too. I hear they have a kid right around yours and Gilroy's age. Can't we meet them some other time so I can ride with Gilroy now? You'll have plenty of chances to ride with your friends. Right now, we need to welcome new ones to the neighborhood, help them feel at home. It's the right thing to do. Oh, I remember when we first moved into the neighborhood. Gilroy felt strange and out of place, but that's when he met a certain llama for the first time. Yep, and now we're good friends. We'd better get going. See ya! Bye, Llamas! Mmm-mmm! So this is for the new neighbors as well as the honey and the rhubarb pie. I have a better idea. I'm super hungry, so why don't we eat it? Then we can make more and go visit the neighbors some other time? Oh, Llama, taking food or a gift to new neighbors makes them feel welcome, so that's what we're doing. Huh! Think about if you were in a new place. Wouldn't you like it if someone brought you something? I was in a new place when we moved here, and no one brought me anything then. I guess you were too young to remember. Wow, I guess they did visit and bring us things. Let's go meet the new neighbors. Do I have to be friends with the new kid? I mean, I already have friends, and what if... What if they don't like us, or me? My sweet Llama, there's no need to be worried. The new kid neighbor may turn out to be really nice and a new friend. You'll have to see. Plus, how could anyone possibly not like you? Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Antelope. We're the Llamas from a couple doors down. We just wanted to stop by and welcome you to the neighborhood with a couple of treats. Well, isn't that sweet of you? Oh, please come in. It's a really wonderful town. We'd be happy to answer any questions about it. Oh, thank you. We'll definitely have some. It's so different here. Before here, we lived in an apartment in the city with a lot of tall buildings. But here, we have a yard. I'm even thinking about starting a little garden. My mama has a garden. I try. Llama Llama, you should meet our daughter Audrey. She's just about your age. Come on. She's right in her room unpacking. Audrey, this is Llama Llama, our new neighbor. Hi. Nice to meet you. Hi. Thanks for coming over, Llama Llama. Uh, do you need any help? Sure. That's really nice of you. Huh? Just wondering, what happened there? Oh, I was born this way. This too. Oh. You can walk on it, but is it hard to play? Nah. Neither my arm or leg slow me down. Actually, my leg is springy, so it helps me jump higher playing basketball. Oh, you play basketball? Yup. Soccer too. Cool! Thanks again for stopping by. You really made us feel welcome. Maybe the kids can have a playdate one of these days. Great idea. Is that your bike? Yup, it is. It's almost the same as yours, Llama. In fact, honey, are you meeting your friend Gilroy to go riding? Yeah... I would invite you, Audrey, but Gilroy has practice really soon and... Are you sure? It would be the right thing to do. Maybe we can have that playdate in a day or two. Okay, a playdate sounds really good. Great. Hi, everyone. I heard there was a new family on the block, so I wanted to stop by and meet you. I'm Luna. Hi, Luna. This is Mr. and Mrs. Antelope. And this is Audrey. Nice to meet everyone. Oh, Audrey! Cool bike! It's like Llama Llama's. Are you still going riding with Gilroy? I was going to meet him now. You should come with us too, Audrey. We're putting together a playdate in a day or two. Why don't you all ride together then? Good idea. Okay. Then maybe we could give you a tour of your new town. What's the new neighbor girl like? She's nice... but she's busy unpacking, so she couldn't ride with us today. I think she would have liked to if we really asked. Maybe. Llama, can I talk to you for just a moment? Be right back. Do you want me to clean my room? No, it's about Audrey. You seem to feel uncomfortable around her. Maybe a little. Is it because of her disability? Her arm and foot? No, it just feels weird bringing a new kid into our group of friends. Well, she and Luna sure seemed to hit it off, and Audrey seems to like you. I know, but... what if Luna likes Audrey better than me and just wants to play with her? What if all my friends do? You know you and Luna will always be friends, and so will the others. Hm, I understand you've been worried about this since we went to meet the Antelopes. This is a new situation for you. Not easy. But you also have to think about Audrey's feelings. She doesn't know anyone in our town. You're right. Okay, Mama. Hey, if it's not too late, maybe she'll come riding with us now. Sorry I didn't invite you earlier. I know it must be hard to be new in the neighborhood, so... Audrey, do you wanna come ride with all of us? I definitely do. Oh! Have fun, Audrey. Let's ride! Your leg looks super springy spring. Is it? It is, and I can play almost anything with it. It's great for bike-riding. Oh, yeah? Wanna race? Yeah! To the end of the path? Whoa! Yes! That was super fun, Audrey, but I'll win next time! It's so awesome to be able to ride my bike around like this. There was way too much traffic in the city we moved from. There are lots and lots of places to ride here in our town. Yeah! We should show Audrey some. The pond is one of my favorite places to ride around, and in the winter, it freezes over, so we can ice-skate on it. No way! I can't wait to do that. And the park is my favorite place to ride. Plus, you can play soccer, basketball, and a million other things. Cool bike! It looks almost the same as Llama Llama's. Nelly and Euclid, this is Audrey, our new... friend. She just moved in. Hi, Nelly and Euclid. Welcome, Audrey! Have you seen downtown yet? Down there is the grocery store. And that's the book and toy store. Wow! All your stores are so close together. Thank you all for showing me around and for making me feel welcome. We're not done yet. Let's go to the best place in town. My dad's bakery! Ooh, a little welcome-to-town gift, Audrey. Still warm for maximum yumminess. Thank you so much. Mmm! It tastes as yummy as it smells. That is the best hill ever! In the summer, you can ride down it in a cardboard box, and in the winter, we sled down in the snow. That's so awesome. Oh, look! A garden. Hey, that's my dad. Over there are the vegetables. Carrots, turnip and rhubarb. That's what I made the pie from. Hi, Dad. Hi, Mama Llama. Wow! Look at all the friends you've already made, Audrey. I know, and they're showing me so many cool places in town to play and ride bikes and play sports. Sports? That reminds me. It's time for my soccer game. Good luck! Have fun! Bye! Have fun! Go ahead, watch Gilroy's game. Oh, wonderful. Thank you. And it's so nice to have you in our town, Audrey. I'm super glad you moved here and got to spend the day with my friends. You're pretty awesome. Thanks, Llama Llama. There's a problem. I don't think we can have our game today. We need one more player. Not a problem. Audrey plays soccer. That's right. I do. I could-- Play? Now? Great! Let's go! It's like she's been here all along. I know! Right! Hey! It's a Llama Llama day Time to learn and time to play Llama, Gilroy, Nelly Gnu What will best friends find to do? Don't you worry, don't you fuss Every day is fun with us Games, adventure, friendship, drama","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age

Babies","Author":null,"Source":"Netflix","Age Max":12,"Age Min":7,"Content":"Every living creature starts life as a baby. For each, there's a whole new world to discover. There'll be joy, and friendship. But life also brings challenges. Some have devoted parents to protect them. Others must fight every step of the way. These newborns will never be more vulnerable. The journey toward adulthood will be hard. To survive takes courage, determination… and above all… love… for babies born wild. The windswept shores of the Namib Desert, where barren sand dunes run down to the icy sea. It doesn't seem possible for life to exist here. And yet… …a colony of Cape fur seals. Around 4,000 of them. These marine mammals spend most of the year at sea. But now, in summer, females gather on land to give birth. Amorous males are here too. They've turned this isolated beach into one noisy, chaotic seal hub. In the midst of it all… after eight months of pregnancy… …a new life is about to begin. At last, making his entrance into the world, little Tabo. A male, weighing just 13 pounds. In these first seconds, his senses are flooded by the rowdy colony around him. But his only focus right now is on his mom. For her, it's love at first sight. She's naturally protective of her precious new baby. Giving Tabo his first wash, she takes in his distinct smell. And their unique calls will help them recognize each other against the clamor of the colony. Until he can swim, in six weeks' time, he's totally dependent on her for all his food and protection. Right now, he's ready for his first milk. High in calories and full of fat, it will help Tabo grow and put on weight. But it won't last forever. To keep him healthy, soon his mom must return to sea to find food. It will mean leaving Tabo alone and defenseless. Here in the colony, there's safety in numbers, but this is far from being one big, happy family. Other mothers only have eyes for their own pups. And amongst these bulls, there's no such thing as fatherly care. Tabo will have to face life in this large crowd of strangers all by himself, as his precious time with his mom grows short. For new arrivals, it's hard to start life out in the open. Other babies are wisely hidden from the moment of birth, especially when they're destined to be rulers of the African savanna. In a palm thicket hideout, new life. Three lion cubs. Two sons and a daughter, only four weeks old. With eyes just opened, they take their first faltering steps in this big new world. While the boys explore… Kaya, the little female, hangs back with Mom. Unlike her brothers, she'll spend her whole life with her pride. The bond between lionesses is strong from the very start. Her elder brother is already displaying confidence. But Kaya is more reserved. She'll have to be brave if she's to overcome the dangers these cubs face. Their spotty coats camouflage them for a reason. In this dog-eat-dog world, every other predator here would kill these newborn cubs. That's if they can get past Mom. She's their fiercest protector. For the next four weeks, she'll do everything she can to keep her babies hidden until they're strong enough to join their pride. For many new arrivals, the protection of a family is the only thing keeping them safe. But sometimes, family decisions can also lead to trouble. Meet little Jasiri, an elephant calf just a few weeks old. He's so young, he's still finding his feet. Born in the dry grasslands of Northern Kenya… …life for this little calf will mean constant traveling… …while trying to keep up with his mom in a sea of tree trunks. In their search for fresh grass, this family can walk over ten miles a day. But with a baby in tow, they'll always slow down. Like most babies, little Jasiri needs regular milk and rest. But they can't stop for too long. It's time to go. But keeping such little legs on the move sometimes requires gentle persuasion. After their morning's grazing, the herd move on to the river. All that fiber for breakfast leaves them thirsty. But the river is key to their lives for another reason. It's where the clans gather. Old friends catch up. And youngsters get together for a pool party. In fact, everyone has fun, whatever their age. All except Jasiri. He could easily get lost in a crowd this big. After nearly two years of pregnancy… …Mom keeps her precious baby as close as possible. Some of the family are wading further out. Elephants crisscross this river every day, driven to find fresh grass. But Mom's instinct tells her that today's conditions aren't right. Stored in her remarkable memory is almost every crossing she's ever made. She knows the water holds many dangers. Shifting sands create deep channels of turbulent water… that can sweep a tiny calf right off its feet. She'll have to decide. Either she follows her family and risks her calf's life… or they get separated from the herd, where neither is likely to survive. For every new arrival, some of the hardest lessons occur when one of the simplest rules of survival is broken. Staying where it's safe. On the desert sand in Namibia, Tabo's been lapping up all his mom's attention. One week old, he's looking fat and healthy. But he's blissfully unaware that life is about to change. His mom must go and feed at sea. Until she returns, little Tabo must be brave and stay put. Alone for the very first time. He desperately looks for her… and immediately breaks Mom's first rule. \"Don't wander off.\" No other mother here will care for him. It's a tough lesson to learn. His searching puts him right in the path of some heavy traffic. These 500-pound males have just one thing on their mind. To mate with females. They steamroll over anyone who gets in their way. Tabo's had a lucky escape. But with every step he takes… he's wandering further into trouble. It might be scary inside the colony… but it's even more dangerous outside. Stray pups like Tabo are exactly what this predator is looking for. A new day in the African bush… and the cubs are being shown the boundary of their secret hideaway. While her brothers stick close to their mom, Kaya is struggling to keep up. That's why, until they're a couple of months old, cubs are kept separate from their family. Lions cover huge distances following prey. And not too far away, that's exactly what their family is doing. This is the MalaMala pride… rulers of a prime spot of territory along the Sand River. Six lionesses and 14 teenage cubs, led by a powerful coalition of brothers. But right now, this pride has a problem. A herd of buffalo. Each one, half a ton of aggression with razor-sharp horns that can easily kill a lion. So the pride must surround them and single one out. But the tables have turned. These teenagers are nervous, incompetent hunters. They're messing it up for the rest of the pride. As another hunt fails, tempers are running high. Soon, Kaya and her brothers must join this family. But when fights break out… young cubs can get injured if they're caught in the line of fire. It's a risk Mom can't take. She'll have to keep Kaya and her brothers hidden for now. But life is tough being a single mom. She'll have to hunt alone, and there's no guarantee that she'll find enough food to keep her cubs alive. For a baby born wild, survival often depends on the decisions of your family. In Kenya, little Jasiri is about to get a valuable first lesson on trust and judgment. While he's enjoying a closely supervised paddle… his mom seems anxious. Her family intend to cross the river. As they finally decide to go… she has no option but to follow. Ahead, it's suddenly clear the family have made a rash decision. Some of the older calves are in trouble. And Jasiri's mom is having second thoughts. But as the calves find their footing… she's forced to try again. Using her trunk, she gauges the speed of the current… and tests the stability of the sand. Jasiri shelters nervously beneath her. But he's caught by the current. Her worst nightmare has come true. She just about manages to support him with her trunk. But they're still a distance from the bank. The current takes Jasiri again. She's only got seconds. Ahead, the rapids will sweep him away for good. Just in time, she catches him. Family help is on the way. Together, they form a wall of bodies to block the current… and Jasiri is guided across. At last… weak and exhausted, he's safe. On his journey through life, there'll be many rivers to cross, but this first one will never be forgotten. Only time will tell if this harrowing experience will affect Jasiri's trust in his family in the months to come. In Namibia, it's been 48 hours since Tabo's mom went to sea. In searching for her, he's become lost. With no friends in the colony to turn to, he's vulnerable. A brown hyena… drawn in by the irresistible smell of seal pups. She's looking for those that have been left on their own. Tabo's only chance is to get back inside the colony. But his wanderings have left him hot and dehydrated. He makes it close to the shore… but that's as far as he can go. Tabo has been spotted. Wary of an adult's bite, the hyena checks for Mom. Tabo needs her now more than ever. She hears her son's desperate cries. Tabo is safe for now. But with the pupping season in full swing… other predators are on the prowl. Soon, Tabo will need all the courage and bravery he can muster when more danger comes calling.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-PG","Word Count":1674,"Year Published":2022,"Season & Episode":"S01E01"},"example_id":"1128b39e-770f-49d2-9d8d-e6bee32913d1","annotations":[{"end":50,"tag":"Behavioral","start":46,"value":"give","tag_id":"4e4637f2-48c3-452e-b7db-d1cace295a4d","correct":false,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"1128b39e-770f-49d2-9d8d-e6bee32913d1","annotated_by":[{"annotator":null,"timestamp":null,"annotator_id":null}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"bae191ee-2071-4f5e-a59f-5804aa3b7551"},{"end":42,"tag":"Non-Living Kind","start":38,"value":"land","tag_id":"a4288773-f6c5-4bc8-8dff-2b16b8f4787e","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"1128b39e-770f-49d2-9d8d-e6bee32913d1","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:30:59.439+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:50:07.644+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T02:56:37.318+00:00","annotator_id":5}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"4039f3b4-4bdd-47b1-b036-0dde9b6380ef"},{"end":56,"tag":"Behavioral","start":46,"value":"give birth","tag_id":"4e4637f2-48c3-452e-b7db-d1cace295a4d","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"1128b39e-770f-49d2-9d8d-e6bee32913d1","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:31:02.655+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T02:57:35.732+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:50:20.557+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"691ebdd7-837e-43e4-8dad-2b286bdfbb16"},{"end":27,"tag":"Social Kind/Role","start":20,"value":"females","tag_id":"c2d08238-bcff-4c44-af7c-74c991a2afb3","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"1128b39e-770f-49d2-9d8d-e6bee32913d1","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:30:45.902+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:50:12.671+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"905a761a-255c-4403-a818-56a1722b2054"},{"end":34,"tag":"Behavioral","start":28,"value":"gather","tag_id":"4e4637f2-48c3-452e-b7db-d1cace295a4d","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"1128b39e-770f-49d2-9d8d-e6bee32913d1","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:30:54.159+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T02:56:37.317+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:50:07.643+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"de8130cb-e718-4cdc-b9b8-74ea19cce87e"},{"end":18,"tag":"Non-Living Kind","start":12,"value":"summer","tag_id":"a4288773-f6c5-4bc8-8dff-2b16b8f4787e","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"1128b39e-770f-49d2-9d8d-e6bee32913d1","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:30:50.091+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:50:07.641+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"d9e4ec43-ac12-4de7-b71e-83ef9445a71e"},{"end":27,"tag":"Biological Kind","start":20,"value":"females","tag_id":"b3c56c74-2d45-483d-945d-9103cf870c36","correct":false,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"1128b39e-770f-49d2-9d8d-e6bee32913d1","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T02:56:58.547+00:00","annotator_id":5}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"bf8a31f1-75ed-47dd-b0b4-768cecf73b0c"}],"classifications":[]},{"content":"I'll come back later for a good scratch.","seen_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","annotator_id":5}],"comments":[],"metadata":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"Ease":46.01,"Genre":null,"Grade":8.3,"Notes":null,"Title":"Octonauts: Above & Beyond","Author":null,"Source":"Netflix","Age Max":6,"Age Min":0,"Content":"Octo-Agents, please report. Explore! Rescue! Protect! Octonauts! Above and Beyond! The Octonauts and the Snag Hotel. Oh. Min to Tweak. I've located more fallen trees near your location and noted them on my map. You'll find a grove with several fallen trees on the ground. I'll be right there to move them for you, Min, just as soon as I get this one over to the mulcher muncher. Good work, Tweak. By removing this dry wood, we're helping Min prevent forest fires here in Thailand. That's right, Captain. Dry wood burns faster, so it can cause forest fires to spread very quickly. So we munch the dry wood into mulch with a mulcher muncher. And the mulch we make from the fallen trees will help the soil and encourage healthy new trees to grow. This one looks like it might fall. Definitely hollow. Excuse me! Would you please stop that? You'll wake my guests. Guests? I was just checking to see if we need to move this tree. Eh! Eh! Move it? This tree is occupied! It's a snag. A snag? A snag tree is a hollow tree that creatures use for shelter. My name is Choti. I run this place. I like to think of it as a snag hotel. Uh, what's with all the racket, Choti? Oh, sorry about the noise, Mr. Gekko. I assure you it won't happen again. Tokay gecko, very clingy. It's because he has extremely sticky feet. He sleeps during the day, so… …we try to keep the noise down. Ah. Mr. and Mrs. Hornbill have their nest in that room there. They're expecting a chick any day now. Oh, forgive me, Choti. I had no idea this tree was occupied. No harm done. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to go back to the top floor. Black giant squirrels like me prefer living high up in the trees. Wait, Choti! Your tree isn't stable. I can't reach this itch on my back. If only I could… Ooh! Ooh! Oh yeah. That's the spot! Excuse me. I thought I explained this. Shaking the tree disturbs my guests! Oh, oh. Oh, never mind. I… I thought you were that red panda. Nope, I'm a sun bear, and this tree is a perfect back scratcher. Excuse me. I'm Min. I'm an Octo-Agent. And you are? Call me Atif. Want to try scratching your back on this tree, Min? Uh, no, thank you. Atif, there are creatures living in this tree. Your scratching could tip it over and hurt them. But it feels so good! I'm going to need some help with this. Better sound the Octo-Alert. Octo-Agent Min, report please. I'm right here, Captain. Oh, uh, right. As you can see, this hollow tree full of creatures is in danger of being knocked down by this very itchy sun bear named Atif. Scratchy, scratchy. Excuse me. Scratchy, scratchy, scratchy. Uh, would you mind scratching your back on some other tree? One that's not occupied. Let me try, Cap'n. I know an old pirate trick. I could sure use a nice, cosy nap right about now. A nap does sound good. See? Works every time. I bet me granddad's peg leg that he'll leave and take a nap any moment now. Ooh! That looks like the perfect spot to doze off. Hey, that's my nest! Whoa! Oh! This calls for some polar bear strength. There. Much better. Better? How is it better? This sun bear is making my snag hotel absolutely unlivable for my guests. Then we'll just have to find you and your guests another place to live. I've marked a few other dried out hollow trees on my map. We can inspect them together and make sure they're shipshape. Y'all can take the Gup-M to speed up your search. And Tweak and I will make sure this tree doesn't fall over. Octonauts, commence Operation Relocation. Now, here's a cosy snag. Hmm. Cosy as in too small. Next! This snag is warm and inviting. Hmm. I won't be inviting those noisy neighbors. Next! Ah! I suppose this one could do. Great! Sold! I know, next! All that sleeping sure made me hungry. Ooh! Excuse me. Oh! Don't you worry. I'll come back later for a good scratch. Now's our chance to move the guests to their new snag. One problem, Captain. We haven't found a new snag to move them to. Then maybe we can move this snag. I figure I can lift it with the Terra-Gup 1 without harming it. All right, me hearties. You need to abandon ship… uh, snag. Just for a bit, while we move it. I'm sticking to this tree no matter what. I'm afraid we can't go anywhere either. Our egg is about to hatch, so I sealed up our nest to keep them safe. \"Them\"? Are you saying Mrs. Hornbill is sealed inside there too? Only for five months! Just until our chick is old enough to fly. It's not so bad. There's a little hole where I bring them food. But they're not going anywhere for now. We can't risk harming the hornbills. Looks like we'll have to move this tree upright. It'll be a little wobbly, Cap. But the Terra-Gup 1 can handle it. I can use my map to lead you on the smoothest path to the safest location just across the river. Excellent. Kwazii and I will stay behind to make sure Atif doesn't follow you. Careful around the roots, Tweak. Whoa! Careful! Sorry about that, Mrs. Hornbill. We'll be fine just as soon as we make it across that rope bridge. Hey, where'd my scratching tree go? Now, Atif, I'm sorry, but the creatures in that tree were in danger, so we had to move it. Plenty more trees in the forest, matey. We can help you find one. Like this one. Sleek, stylish, a real itch-scratcher. But I want my scratching tree! Hey! Come back with that! That's it, Tweak. Slow and steady. Yes, steady's good. Please be careful. My wife and chick are inside. I can do the slow part. Not so sure about steady. No, no, forget slow. Atif is right on our tail. Hold on, Atif! Let me pass. That's my scratching tree. No can do, matey. There are creatures in that snag. Whoa! Help! Oh no! Whoa! Ah! Whoa! Tweak, open the hatch! Thanks, Choti. Oh! That was amazing! We said we'd get you across safe, didn't we? That should keep this old bridge together for a good, long while. Oh, I can't thank you Octonauts enough. This is even lovelier than our old spot. And just look at that view! I'll be happy to… stick around. This will be the perfect spot to raise our family. The snag hotel is on the map. But what will Atif do without his special scratching tree? Oh, don't worry, Min. Kwazii and I left him something even more special. Mulch pile! Mmm. This feels so good on my itches! Oh. Ooh. Scratchy, scratchy! Octo-Ray to Octopod. Incoming Octo-Report. Octo-Agents, please report. Octo-Report! Octo-Report! Octo-Report! Octo-Report! Dashi reporting… snag trees! A tree can always Shelter creatures quite well But if it's hollow It's a nature hotel Squirrels are happy On the uppermost limb But use the hollow trunk For building nests in See how a hornbill chick Stays protected inside Their parents close them in Till they're ready to fly They left a hole For getting food to the nest This snag hotel knows How to pamper its guests Yeah. Check it out! Snag trees! The mission is done Now, Agents, prepare To follow the call To adventure anywhere! The Octonauts and the Stubborn Albatross. The waves are getting bigger here in the Pacific, and the sea level appears higher than last year. I think you're right. Warmer temperatures are causing more ice to melt in the Arctic and Antarctic, which means more water in the oceans. Aye, Dashi. At some point, this entire island will be underwater, which is bad news for the albatross who nest here every year. Sorry, Dashi. Gotta go! Wait! This island's not safe! Um, excuse me, you shouldn't build your nest here. Don't be silly. We albatross build our nest here every year. Always have, always will. It's different now. The water's much higher than it used to be. You're right! We can't possibly build our nest here. Phew! But here… Now, this is a swell spot for a nest. Oh, sweetheart! You always pick the best spots. No, no, that's not what I meant. Nowhere on this island is safe. Ah, back again. And our nesting spot is lovelier than ever. I'm so sorry, but you shouldn't build your nest here. But it's albatross tradition. We nest here every year. Always have… …always will. We've gotta snag the best spot before the others get here! \"Others\"? Oh, I'm going to need some back-up. Better sound the Octo-Alert. Ah. Octo-Agent Pearl, report please. Aye, Captain. I have a situation with some stubborn albatross who refuse to leave this atoll. Refusing to leave what at all? Not \"at all,\" Kwazii. An atoll is a ring-shaped island made of coral reef. Because of rising sea levels from climate change, this one's going to be completely underwater soon. Maybe even sooner than you think. Here's the atoll, and my weather tracker shows a storm on the way. And once this storm hits, the waves will flood the atoll. That's really bad news for the albatross who nest here every year. We need to find them a new nesting ground and get them there safely. Agreed! In the meantime, we'll need to protect the albatross from those waves. That sounds like a job for me and the Terra-Gup 2. All right. Dashi, Tweak, and Kwazii, with me to the Octo-Ray. Octonauts, let's do this! Captain, part of the atoll is already underwater. Then we'll have to act fast. No problem, Cap. We can get this done faster than you can say, \"Buncha munchy crunchy carrots.\" Yow! Those waves look even higher from down here. Which is why I need to start building a sand barrier to protect the shoreline. Good thinking, Tweak. Meanwhile, Kwazii and I will ask these albatross not to nest here. That will be difficult. They're quite stubborn. We can handle anything on this-- What was that? An oyster shell. Watch out, they're everywhere. Those, I think we can handle. In the meantime, Pearl, you and I can take the Octo-Ray to search for safer nesting grounds. That's strange. My map says there should be an atoll right here. But there's nothing down there. Hold on. Here it is. It's completely underwater! And that's what'll happen to the albatross's nesting ground before long. Then we'll have to keep looking until we find a safe place for them to nest. Hello there. We are the Octonauts. We're working on finding you a new nesting ground, and we can move you before the storm floods the island. Leave here? How could we leave? We'd lose this swell spot. Did you not hear what the captain said? Your nest is going to be deep under the briny! Ha. I find that hard to believe! Our parents made their nest here. So did my grandparents. And my grandparents. And my grandparents' grandparents. And don't forget about Aunt Judy! It's perfect here. It's not perfect, mateys. The water's rising. A storm's a-coming-- And there's scurvy oyster shells everywhere. Now, this atoll looks promising. Wait. What's that? Oh, just a little mouse. Just a little mouse to us, but mice are a big threat to albatross eggs. Hmm. Albatross eggs? Where? They're delicious! You won't be getting any eggs today, but I have something better. Mm, mm, mmm. Delicious! Delicious! What's delicious? Did somebody say albatross eggs? Delicious! Albatross eggs! Delicious! Albatross can't nest here with all these hungry mice around. We'll have to keep looking. Here, eat these. Mm, mm, mmm. Delicious! Delicious! Uh, look, the thing is, I can certainly understand why you don't want to leave this atoll, but I'm afraid you're going to have to. Well, we can't leave now. Uh, why is that exactly? Oh! Shiver me whiskers! She's already laid an egg. Oh, honey. It's perfect! The perfect egg in the perfect nesting spot. Ah, this complicates things. We'll have to protect the egg until we can move it to a new nesting ground. Tweak, how's the barrier coming? All done, Cap. Correction. There's nothing on this atoll strong enough to hold back the waves. You're right. There's a lot of sand and not much else. Not again! Wait a minute. That's it! We can use these oyster shells to make a stronger barrier. Great idea, Tweak! There's certainly plenty of oyster shells to build with. Aye, I think I've stepped on half of them. The storm is moving in fast. We don't have much time. This island is large with lots of beaches, and there are no signs of mice or other predators that prey on the eggs. It's perfect! Oh, it looks like some other sea birds have already figured that out. Oh! What about the other side of the island? Lots of open space to build nests, no predators, and not overcrowded. Oh, now that really is the perfect albatross nesting ground! Captain, we found a new nesting ground. Excellent, but hurry back. The storm's almost here, and now we have to protect an egg. An egg? On our way, Captain. Oyster shell barrier complete! And not a moment too soon! I just hope it can last until Dashi and Pearl get back here. What do you mean, matey? Look at it. It's rock solid. Maybe solid enough for that wave, but they keep getting bigger! Octonauts, brace the barrier! I hope Dashi gets here soon! What in the world is happening? The storm we were trying to warn you about, it's finally hit, matey! Oh dear, we hate storms. Always have… …always will! Our egg! Your egg is safe and sound. Thanks, Octonauts! Let's go! Attention, albatross. Follow us. Shiver me whiskers. There's nowhere to go! Nowhere to go but up! Aha! As I was saying, follow us to your new nesting ground. You heard him, everybody. We always stick with our eggs! Always have, always will! Now, this is the perfect nesting spot. We thought you might feel that way. You Octonauts really saved the day. Always have, always will! Octo-Ray to Octopod. Incoming Octo-Report. Octo-Agents, please report. Octo-Report! Octo-Report! Octo-Report! Octo-Report! Dashi reporting… albatrosses! These albatrosses Have a place they like best One that they always choose For building a nest Islands of coral In the shape of a ring They're known as atolls And they're just the right thing They're perfect nesting spots But eventually All of these islands might Vanish under the sea The warming climate means Sea levels rise high With fewer atolls Keeping nesting birds dry Yeah.

How was your weekend? We had a weekend? I had no idea. I was busy working on my new story. What's it about? Working too much on weekends. Sounds relevant. And speaking of stories, I have a great idea for Buzzblast. Fantastic, Amelia! As long as it's not about some paranormal nonsense. Uh, well... Morning. Did we really just have a weekend? Uh-huh. OK, let's hear your big idea. There's an old historic landmark deep in the woods called Dinohenge. Dinohenge? Dinohenge, huh. And remember, never eat the gloop. It's supposed to be haunted, right? So you are trying to write another article on ghosts. No. No, no, no, no. Technically, I'm trying to write my first article on ghosts. Well, for a start, you need special permission to visit that area of the forest. Oh, I totally got permission. Secondly, as I always say, Buzzblast isn't about ghosts and sasquatches. It's about skateboards and singers, fashionable foods and top-ten travel tips. Don't you have a lip-gloss review due today? I did it yesterday. Tune in tomorrow for my review on this year's best glow-in-the-dark lip glosses. And as always, click \"like\" and subscribe to Buzzblast. Wow! I love that! Do you have some samples I can borrow? I left some on your desk. But really, Jane, I wanna do something different. OK, Dinohenge it is. But I want a factual story about a local landmark. Nothing paranormal. Don't worry. It'll be factual. OK. Yeah! OK, folks, I'm being very quiet as I approach Dinohenge with my Spook Snare, which both detects and captures ghosts. That's right, Buzzblasters, today, I'm proving ghosts are real. Whoa! A ghost. Finally! This Spook Snare was worth every penny. It's getting closer. Jane doesn't want a ghost story, but this will blow her mind. Easy. Ah! : Help! Help! Sorry! I thought that you were someone else. Hold on. I'll deactivate it. : Wrong... button! Are you OK? That thing really smarts. Come on. It can't hurt that much. Ow! I mean, I hardly felt a thing. What are you doing shooting nets at people? I'm a reporter working on a story for Buzzblast. What are you doing here? Online reviews said it was a great place to get zapped. So I'm giving it five stars. Well, now I'm late. Ugh. So, which way? Uh... Man, I told Mom we shouldn't have split up. How am I gonna find Dinohenge now? Dinohenge? That's where I'm going. And... I have a map. It's... that way. I'm Ollie, by the way. Amelia. So, you're clearly not here for zaps, so what's your deal? Mom and I just moved to Pine Ridge. She's an archaeologist, wants to unearth some of the history here. Well, you're in luck. This place is packed with crazy history. See for yourself. No way! Where'd they come from? Nobody knows. Amazing, aren't they? They're carvings of dinosaurs. Could be millions of years old. Who could possibly have been around to make them? I'm Dr Akana. I'm Amelia. I'm a doing a story on Dinohenge for Buzzblast. Fantastic to meet you. Our first day here, and you've already made a friend. I like her. Yeah, 'cause she didn't shoot you with an electrified net. Huh? Oh, it's nothing. So, what exactly are you working on here? Oh, we're gonna try and solve the mystery of Dinohenge with the help of my scanning system. Wow. That's some cool tech. So the scanner's mounted on the drone? That's right. Its sensors can detect buried structures. Here we go. Uh, did you see that? The dinosaurs' eyes. How intriguing! Is that an earthquake? Is that an earthquake? Very unusual. Look at that. Below the Dinohenge statues, there's some sort of... ...chamber. Underground? Right here? No way! What's going on here, folks? Great. It's Warden Buzzkill. Good afternoon, Warden Buzzkill. I'm Dr Lani Akana from the Global Association of Archaeology. It's Park Warden Garcia, actually. And you don't have permission to be out here. But, Warden, I'm doing a story on Dino-- Save it, Miss Jones. I don't care if you're a reporter or the Queen of England. You're trespassing. So pack up. Oh, and I'll need you to come back to the Parks HQ and file a report. Happy to comply. It's this way. Load everything into the car and meet me in town. We've got all the data we need for now. OK, Mom. So, you ticked off the Warden once, huh? Once, twice, 17 times. He's not a fan of ghost hunters. Ghost hunters? Are you serious? You shot that net at me because you thought I was a ghost? Well, it was hard to see, and your poncho, and... OK, maybe I did, but come on. Your mom's an archaeologist. You've been in tombs, crypts, catacombs. You must have seen ghosts. Never. Never? Never ever? Nope, because ghosts don't exist. You ever found any proof? Well, proof is hard to come by. Ghosts just don't line up for selfies. But why should I explain myself? You're obviously closed-minded. Closed-minded? Try rational. Rational people do not believe in things without evidence. I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. Strongly disagree. : Energy source detected. Under those old statues? Interesting. : Energy source locked on. Excellent. Where are you going? To check it out. You're not afraid, are you? Uh, of course not. I've been in plenty of tombs, chambers, all sorts. OK, expert,... let's go. Wow! Look at this place. Mom will flip. Wait till my boss sees my Dinohenge story. Where's that energy source? It must be mine. Huh? What's this? Oh! Oh no! Come on, Zayto. I need you! Aargh! Tell me, old lizard. The energy source, where is it hidden? Firstly, I'm a dinosaur, not a lizard. And secondly, old? Ouch! Do not play games with me. I am Void Knight. And you're no match for my power. I'm not, but he is! A Power Ranger? Nice try. : Oh my! Now tell me... Where's the energy source? Can you be more specific? Don't you play the fool with me. What?! Leave the old dinosaur alone. This may come as a shock, but no one likes a bully. You'll pay for this! That won't hold him long. So put this key in the saber, and then the Hengemen will fight for you. Wrong. They're going to fight for me! : Uh-oh! A new toy. I'll enjoy this. : Bad vibes. Hengemen, show me what you've got! Amelia, Pine Ridge has been great, but I don't think it's for me. Uh, any ideas? I've done three years of karate. Yeah, me too. And six years of fencing. OK, so you wanna take the lead? What? Pathetic! Deal with them! Back off! Where is it? I'm sorry, Zayto. This might just be too damaged to wake you up. Aargh! Whoa! Let me know if you need any help. I was gonna say the same to you! Aargh! Well, this was fun. Was it?! Ollie, is your saber kinda glowy? Yeah. What's with that? : Oh, wow! Uh, OK... They have Morphers! I haven't seen that since... Here, have these! Whoa! What's happening? : Ha ha! Yes! : What?! : All right! We're... We're Power Rangers! : Emphasis on \"power\". You're in big trouble now! Tear them apart! Coming at you! Cool powers, costumes, and weapons! What other stuff do we get? If you watch the news, Zords! Yah! Check it! How's this? : Energy source detected. Energy source locked on. : This must be it. Sporix? They're Sporix! That's the energy I detected, that I need! Take the chest. : No! Don't touch that! Why won't you work? Oh! Finally! Huh? What's going on? Solon, why are the Hengemen activated? And who are they? They're new, and friendly. But the Sporix are being taken! Hurry! : Move! Oh no! Where did you steal that armor from? Doesn't matter. It's mine now, just like the Sporix. : Whatever Sporix are, they're bad, right? Very bad. Bad for you. Good for me! Yah! Too slow! I've got plenty more tricks. Dino Dagger! No! No. No! They're loose! : Oh, this can't be happening! This isn't over! Get back here! No! Well, hello there. Ooh, you're hatching. Yee-haw! You're going to help me get those Sporix back. Yes, boss! : Ugh. : So, that was wild. : Yeah. I got pretty good with this thing. Wow, cool! Can you believe it? We're Power Rangers! I definitely didn't think I'd become a superhero when I woke up this morning. Whoo! I'm Zayto. And this is my wise friend Solon. Greetings. Well, I'm-- Ollie, a rational, logical adventurer and scientist. And you're Amelia, an imaginative and unstoppable truth seeker. How'd you know that? He's showing off. Beings from his planet can read minds. I wasn't showing off. I'm making sure it still works. How long was I in the stasis pod? A very long time, I'm afraid. More than 65 million years. Million? Hey, you're in great shape for 65 million. You know, I think we both are. If Zayto's an extraterrestrial, does that make you a...? A cyborg dinosaur? Yes, a Solonosaurus. But I was badly wounded in an ancient battle against the Sporix. You should tell them, Zayto. 65 million years ago, the Sporix were unleashed on my planet, Rafkon. They hatched into ferocious beasts. I led the Knights of Rafkon,... Attack! ...fighting to defend our home. We were not strong enough. The Sporix Beasts ravaged my planet, leaving few survivors. But their thirst for destruction could not be satisfied. The Sporix left Rafkon, hungry for their next target. Planet Earth. But we followed them. Determined to eradicate the Sporix, we fought alongside the dinosaurs to save Earth. With each battle, the beasts became stronger, until finally, they grew giant. We were forced to retreat. It seemed the Earth, too, would be lost. Until... the legendary Morphin Masters arrived. Ageless beings with untold power, they were here to help us. I'd heard of the Morphin Grid before, but I had no idea how strong it was. The Morphin Grid joined us with the spirits of the dinosaurs. Then the Morphin Masters gave us our mission. : You are the Dino Fury Power Rangers. Together you must defend the Earth against these evil Sporix. But how? The Sporix Beasts are gigantic. : Then, we will make you mighty weapons. So with the Zords' help, you beat the Sporix Beasts? You did win, right? I mean, you're still here to tell the story. It wasn't the kind of victory you celebrate. We captured the Sporix and locked them in this chest. But my friends, the other knights, they were... lost. : Zayto and I tried everything to destroy the Sporix. But it was impossible. All we could do was keep them hidden and guarded. So you've been here ever since? Yes. It's my mission to ensure the Sporix never get loose in the universe again. And today I failed. : All because of this Void Knight. Why would he want the Sporix? I hate to think. But right now, we need to find them and get them back. They'll hide and hibernate, until one by one they hatch into Sporix Beasts. There are dozens and dozens of them, and all they know is destruction. They must be stopped. Your planet is in grave danger. And we're the only ones who can save it. But first things first. You'll need some training. Are you ready? Are you kidding? Just tell us what to do.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-Y7","Word Count":1935,"Year Published":2022,"Season & Episode":"S01E01"},"example_id":"e3a6a0ad-d5a2-40af-b94a-ac0ae1026d12","annotations":[{"end":14,"tag":"Mental State","start":10,"value":"know","tag_id":"2507aaa4-514e-4c68-aa12-4ec759d2625b","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"e3a6a0ad-d5a2-40af-b94a-ac0ae1026d12","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:46:28.924+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:50:56.95+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"10c3dbf4-e1e0-48d5-ae0e-2ce3ff69addc"},{"end":19,"tag":"Anthropomorphized","start":15,"value":"that","tag_id":"3d4327e2-56d5-4da0-a591-1aac6ff5fa9d","correct":null,"reviewed":false,"example_id":"e3a6a0ad-d5a2-40af-b94a-ac0ae1026d12","annotated_by":[{"annotator":null,"timestamp":null,"annotator_id":null}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"90bb2e53-359e-4893-a9be-98877490e6c2"},{"end":14,"tag":"Behavioral","start":10,"value":"know","tag_id":"4e4637f2-48c3-452e-b7db-d1cace295a4d","correct":false,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"e3a6a0ad-d5a2-40af-b94a-ac0ae1026d12","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T14:58:23.478+00:00","annotator_id":5}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"181a0c16-dbcf-4ca3-8ce7-a64d889e3966"},{"end":9,"tag":"Biological Kind","start":6,"value":"you","tag_id":"b3c56c74-2d45-483d-945d-9103cf870c36","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"e3a6a0ad-d5a2-40af-b94a-ac0ae1026d12","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:50:54.862+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:46:24.949+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T14:58:23.474+00:00","annotator_id":5}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"62c34da2-5f3b-4cb0-97e8-f3bd52ba9489"}],"classifications":[]},{"content":"That one went really high up.","seen_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","annotator_id":5}],"comments":[],"metadata":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"Ease":63.95,"Genre":null,"Grade":5.2,"Notes":null,"Title":"Meekah","Author":null,"Source":"Netflix","Age Max":6,"Age Min":0,"Content":"So much to learn about It’ll make you wanna shout Meekah! Hey! It’s me, Blippi, and today I’m at Discovery Cube in Los Angeles, California, and I am so excited to show you around. But first, I have someone really special to introduce to you. Hey, Blippi! Hey, Meekah! Hi, everyone! This is Meekah, and she’s my best friend! Oh, Blippi, you’re my best friend. Oh, no, Meekah, you’re my best friend. I’m so excited to go in and explore Discovery Cube. Yeah! Let’s go! Whoa! Whee! Yeah! Whoa! What are you doing, Meekah? I’m being an airplane. Oh, me too! Whoa! I’m acting like a big plane that carries passengers. Oh, wow! I’m gonna be a really little plane. Whoops! Excuse me! Now I’ll be a jet that goes super fast. Oh, I want to see. Whoa! Whoa! You were so fast! Yeah. I love planes. Oh, check it out. What’s that? Wow, we can make paper airplanes. Cool! Whoa! Shall we? Yeah. All right. Okay, let’s start with blank white pieces of paper. Okay. Let’s fold ’em. Fold it. Wow, I wonder whose is gonna fly faster and further. I don’t know. Probably yours. We’ll have to race! You’re really good at this type of stuff, Meekah. Aw, thanks, Blippi. Yeah. I love making paper airplanes. Oh, that’s silly. Whoa! Here we go. Whoa! Just warming it up. Yours looks so good. All right, and I am almost done. Whoa! Does it look good? I think your plane’s gonna go really far. Really? Check it out. Wow! All right, shall we go see whose plane is more aerodynamic? Ooh, come on. Whoa! Wow! Cool launchpads. Launchpads? Look at these rings. Wow! Maybe this launchpad will launch our paper airplanes and we can make it through the rings. Okay. Good luck, Blippi. Three, two, one, go! Two, one… Whoa! Oh, yeah! That was awesome! That was so fun! Let’s do that again. Whoa! Okay. Wow! Yeah! Do you wanna switch launchpads? Sure. Okay. I wanna see if mine can go through the big orange circle. Okay. I’m gonna aim for that circle too. Okay, ready? Yep. Three, two, one… Two, one… Whoa! We both missed! That’s so silly. That was fun racing you. Yeah. Should we go over there? Yeah, come on. Looks like we can put some things on our arms and act like airplanes together. Wow. Oh, with these? Yeah. Oh, here comes the wind. Wow! Whoa, so windy! Get your wing on! It’s so windy! Yeah! Wow! It was a lot harder to stand up with these on. Yeah. I think the wind was catching it. It was, and it was pushing us back a little bit. Yeah. That was awesome. Yeah. Whoa, check it out. We’re at the Competition Zone. Yeah. Here we get to build our own cars, and we can race each other on the car track. Yeah. Who do you think’s gonna win? I don’t know. I guess we have to see. Yeah, come on. I’m guessing you’re gonna win, Meekah. You're really good. You never know. You’re really fast. All right. Okay. So the first step, we need to choose a chassis, or a base. Yeah. Okay, what base are you gonna use? Let’s see. How about… Yeah! A blue base with an orange stripe, yeah, kinda like my blue shirt with an orange suspender. Whoa! That is a great choice for you, Blippi. What about you, Meekah? I really like this one with the two different color blues, see? A light blue and a dark blue stripe in the middle. Whoa, cool. Yeah, I like that. All right, now for the top. \"Choose a body for your car.\" Yeah. Top, a body. Cool. A body of a car. I like this blue one. Oh, cool. You’re gonna go all blue, huh? Yeah. Ooh, and then this body, I will do an orange car with a blue stripe. Yeah, the opposite of the bottom. That’s so cool. That’s gonna look really nice together. Oh, thanks. Looks like we connect them like this, huh? Whoa, cool! They’re magnetic, so they stick really well together. Yeah! And what does every car need? Hmm… Wheels. Yeah. All right, let’s pick out some wheels and tires. They go right here. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, looks like we need four of them. Probably the same number that your car has. Yeah. Okay. Here we go. All right. Check it out. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! They’re ready to race. Oh, Meekah, looks like we can add some weights to make it heavier. And remove weights to make it lighter. Wow, what’s that gonna do? I wonder if that will help. Should we try? Um, sure. I’ll try a really small one. What are you gonna try? Hmm, I’ll try one, two. All right. I guess-- Oh! A scale. Okay. Let’s see. Mine weighs 101.7 grams. Wow. All right, what about yours? Let’s find out. 106.5. Even though my car is way bigger. Yeah. All right, shall we? Yeah, let’s race them. Wow, check it out. This is the racetrack. Yeah. Hey, it matches my car really well. Oh, yeah, it does. Check it out. Wow! All right. Here we go. Wow. All right. Now we’re at the start of the racetrack. Yep. So let’s get our cars ready. And here’s the launcher. We have to pull it back. Do you want to count down with us? Yeah. Three, two, one, go! Whoa! That was awesome! It was really fun! Who won? I don’t know. I think maybe mine by just a second. Oh, yeah. \"Lane 1.\" That’s me. \"4.1. Lane 2, 3.72.\" Wow! Shall we try it again? Yeah, come on. Okay. Wait. Since your car won, do you mind if I try taking this weight off? Oh, yeah. Let’s see if that helps. All right. All right, and I’ll keep mine on. Let’s see if anything changes. Okay. Pull it back. Ready to count down? Three, two, one… Three, two, one, go! Whoa! You won! Wow! I did win! Good job, Blippi. Thanks, Meekah. Wow, here’s another racetrack. Whoa. Shall we try this one out? Yeah. This one looks really cool. There's turns. Wow! Do you wanna go first? Sure. Thanks. Okay. Pull it back. Okay. I can’t wait to see it do the loop the loop. Yeah. Three, two, one… Go! Wow, look at it go. It’s going around and around. Yeah, it’s going so fast. Whoa! Whoa, last corner. Whoa! Yeah! That was awesome, Meekah! Yeah. Wow. 12.96 seconds. That’s right. Now it’s your turn.

One more turn. Okay. Come on, curve. Whoa! Yeah! Whoa! 18.22. Oh, Meekah, you totally beat me. Huh, I wonder if it’s the weights. I don’t know. Might be the cool-looking blue car. Yeah! Ooh, look, a green track. Okay. This time I’m gonna take one of my weights off. Okay. Ooh, can I borrow it? Do you want to have this one? Sure. I’ll have no weights. All right, and I’ll have one weight. Here we go. Yeah! Two, one, go! Three, two, one, go! Yeah! Go, car, go! Yeah, go, blue car. Go, blue car! Go, blue car! Yeah! Meekah, that was awesome. That was a fun one. Wow, so fast. Let’s see how your car does. All right. Let’s try it out. Ready? Mm-hmm. Three, two, one, go! Oh, yeah, it made it! Whoa! Yeah! Down the track! Whoa! Yeah! That was awesome! Shall we keep exploring? Yeah! Yeah, let’s go. Whoa! Did you see that? Wow! Yeah. It went all the way up to the ceiling. And it made a circle. It really did. So cool. Whoa. Whoa! Whew, some more smoke. Whoa. Whoa! It’s kind of cold. Yeah, it’s colder over here. Yeah. Shall we try and get in? Okay. All right. I can’t see you. Whoa! Whoa. Okay, it’s gone now. Whoa, check it out. Wow. Some windmills. They’re so tall. Yeah, and they’re spinning because wind is blowing into them. Wow. It’s really cool. Because when wind blows through the propeller-type thing, it harnesses the energy. Yeah It’s really good for the Earth. Yeah. Ooh, and speaking of Earth, yeah, there’s a lot of rocks around the Earth. And this is a fake rock wall. Yeah. Have you ever tried one? No. You want to? Yeah! Yes! All right, you go first. Okay, let’s see. Foot here… I love being active. Whoa! Very healthy for you. Whoa! Look. I’m so up high. Wow, cool! All right, I’ll follow you. All right, let's go! Shall we go that way? Sure.

It’s one of my favorite colors. Yeah. It’s the same color as her shirt. Mm-hmm. And… Oh! Last color. Green. Wow! And check this out. When we push these buttons… a lot of wind comes from here all the way up. I don’t feel any wind in mine. Really? Let me try again. Now I do. Yeah, all right. Yeah! Now, you know what to do. Yep. Here we go. Whoo! Whoa! Whoa! Yeah! That one went really high up. Oh, here you go. Oh thank you. Oh, I’ll catch ’em. Whoa! All right. Wow! The wind is so powerful. Whoa! Yeah! And these scarves are so light, and they just fly up in the air. Yep. Whoa. Whoa! Wow. All right, there we go. Let’s throw ’em in one last time. Okay. One. Three, two, one, go! Yeah! That was awesome. Whoa! A wind machine. Wow. It’s so cool. Oh, I wanna try it. Have you ever been inside one? Huh-uh. Well, it gets really windy. Ooh, fun! All right.

Yeah. Well, this is the end of this video, but if you wanna watch more of my videos, all you have to do is search for my name. Yep. Will you spell my name with me? Of course. B-L-I-P-P-I. \"Blippi.\" Good job. Wait a second. Meekah, how do you spell your name? Oh, I’ll show you. It’s… M-E-E-K-A-H. \"Meekah.\" Cool! See you later. Bye.

By facing off against some of the most iconic snacks ever created. First, they'll have to crack the code and reconstruct one of these beloved classics. And then create their own new snack inspired by that beloved classic. It's a competition where skill and science must be perfectly aligned to succeed. Come and see how good this looks. Only one will prevail, claiming a $50,000 grand prize. So good. This feels like a million-dollar idea. This is Snack VS. Chef. Welcome, everybody. Hi! Hello. I'm Hari Kondabolu. And I'm Megan Stalter. We're your hosts. Two snack-food-loving comedians who can't wait to chow down. Please welcome Ali Bouzari and Helen Park, aka the judges. Hey, guys. I'm a chef, and I have a PhD in food biochemistry. So I'm gonna be looking for the ability to blend science with a bit of chef-y intuition. I'm a chef with a research and development background. I bring food concepts and ideas to life from prototype to huge scale mass production. You've been brought here to tackle the toughest challenge of your careers. Snacks. Snacks are simply complex. It takes a lot of nerd rage delicacy to put a lot of fun and functionality into that little bite. Snacks are what brings people together. And while we're competing over snacks, we're competing over something that's loved as a way to bring people together, and I think that's awesome. Today, you'll be competing in two rounds. The first round, you'll be showing off your skills by recreating some of the most beloved, iconic, ridiculously complicated snacks known to humankind. Then you'll create your own signature snack with element of the original. Whoever impresses our judges the most in both rounds gets a guaranteed slot in our finals. And a grand prize of $50,000. As a food editor, I do research and development. When it comes to snacks, I know what people reach for. So I know I can win this competition because I know snacks. We turn now to our magical vending machine, who will select the snack and the three contestants competing. Let's see what the contestants will be cooking up. Boy, let's do it. Flamin' Hot. Flamin' Hot Cheetos. The Cheeto drops, and I'm thinking, \"Please do not choose me.\" It's very difficult to get that crunch. Mm. And the powder is not just this spicy cheese powder. It's got, like, 20 elements to it. Oh. My tongue is on fire, but, like, in a really fun way. Flamin' Hot Cheetos. You're gonna have to pack a ton of umami and sourness so that the second I bite down, it's an explosion of aroma. The other important thing is gonna be getting those corn puffs right. I want to see you guys conjure up consistent textures from inconsistent little squiggly bits without them overcooking. My mouth is on fire, yes. Think you're up for the challenge? So, who's gonna be competing? Vending machine, do your thing. I'm not gonna lie. I'm like, \"Please don't be me.\" My heart is racing. I know. It's Francis! Me. Being picked for Flamin' Hot Cheetos is not the best option, but I'm here to prove myself. I want to show all of you that my snacks are king. The second chef competing is… Ali! I absolutely love Flamin' Hot Cheetos. They're spicy, tangy, a bit sour. And I'm ready to roll. And last but not least. It's Sandy. Flamin' Hot Cheetos. It's like this very specific crunchy little devil that no one actually knows how to make. Except Cheetos. All right, chefs. This game can be yours if you can identify the correct ingredients needed and have the chemical smarts to cook them properly. You will have one hour for this challenge. You'll be doing it from right here. The vending machine slides back and… It's a kitchen. All right, snackers. You have one hour starting now. Grab your stations! The kitchen is huge. There are beakers, pH meters, color and flavor, KitchenAid equipment. I'm so ready for the challenge. Hello, hello, hello. Mm. Mm. Whoo. The Flamin' Hot Cheeto challenge is a two-parter. First, our chefs will have to figure out how to make a Cheeto body by bringing together a corn-based dough that has enough water to expand in the fryer to give a pleasing crunch that's not too dense, but not so airy that it gets poofy like a cheese ball. None of them are the same shape. They are complex. The more you eat them, the more the spice kind of builds. They are crispy. So, this is gonna be interesting. The second part of the challenge is to create the signature Flamin' Hot Cheeto powder. It should be complex. Cheesy, sour, spicy. It'll also have to mimic the way Cheetos famously stick to your fingers. Otherwise known as the Cheetle effect. It's not as easy as it looks. No going outside the box, creating a new flavor. You have to recreate perfectly, and you have an hour to do it. But we're the best of the best, so we got this. We are snack gods. Mm-hmm. So, judges, what's so hard about this challenge? I think there's two main groups, right? Did they get the texture and the flavor? Job one is gonna be picking your corn source. There's so many forms of corn. So whatever the choice, they need to be sure to balance the water content. If their batter is too wet, they'll run into major issues when they start frying. You need to have a plan for what the corn is gonna do for you. Not what you can do for the corn. If you don't have the dough, you have nowhere to go. All right, the first thing you have to do is get your polenta. You normally have to cook it, but it's cooked. I'm using polenta as my base for the Cheeto. You wanna stick in that corn realm, and you wanna get that fluffy fried texture afterwards. So, I'm bringing polenta and everything together with egg whites, garlic powder, a bit of cayenne in here. I really want to create this tacky, sticky pipeable dough, basically. A dough, a batter. I was born in London. My mom is Welsh and my whole family's Scottish. So I feel I encompass the whole of Britain. Since becoming a baker, I had some amazing things to happen to me. Zagat called me the Banksy of bakers, aka the Donut King, aka the Shortbread Saucer. And now I'm ready to be the Snack Emperor! I think I forgot something. All those buggers in the bodega, they have to watch out. Scottish Francis here. I'm gonna win this challenge. All right, we're nearly there. I'm excited. I'm actually cooking my polenta because it will enhance the corn flavor of that Cheeto. It's such a nostalgic snack. It's hot. I love spicy food, so I'm excited to be trying this out and developing flavors. I'm a food scientist, so I'm excited to be doing something along these lines. I am the owner of Umami Food Consulting. I develop products for Chipotle, McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts. I'm bringing my food science background and flavor development to this competition. My goal is to get to the finals by not talking too much. I'm making sure to stay close with my secrets. Come on. Develop those flavors. Not going to cheat. I'm making the Cheetos batter. Just some cornmeal, water, which is polenta. So it's gonna be really simple. Ah, there it is. I finally get that dough-like consistency. I do like Flamin' Hot Cheetos, but I think you can over-eat them because you just want to keep eating them. It's kind of like that Szechuan thing where it's spicy, but it still numbs your mouth so you can't really tell, which I think is fascinating. I've been cooking for 12 years now. I didn't go to culinary school, so I was self-taught. I started cooking about four or five weeks before I opened up my first restaurant. It kind of got really successful real quick, much to my disbelief. Funny thing is I actually have no sense of smell. That has always caused me to have very bold flavor combinations. I tend to make everything intense. So, I should be good because I'll have to go make Flamin' Hot Cheetos now. Hello, Ms. Fun. Hey, how are you? What are you Robot Coupe-ing? I cooked my own polenta. I didn't use any packaged product. Amazing, and you're pureeing it just to get the texture smooth. Yeah, I wanna make sure it's smooth and tacky texture. So when I fry it, it will combine. The shape will form. I wanna make sure you all get the essence of corn. Um, I'm a scientist, so go with what I know. Oh. I accidentally put that egg in there. Do you need to pull it out? Yes. Being under pressure is a bit tough, but I'm trying to maintain my composure. It seems you have a plan. I do. Thank you. You're doing amazing. I dropped the doggone yolk in the doggone batter. It has to be the egg white. It'll be fluffy and crispy and have that nice crunch. This is crazy. So, one of the things people love about Cheetos is that weird residue, right? The Cheetle. The Cheetle. The Cheetle dust. That's what differentiates it from other generic puff snacks. As a kid, my whole goal was to see how much buildup I could get. Absolutely. How much I could raise the tension. I mean, it's basically yummy finger plaque. I mean it's-- Plaque. The Cheetle. All right. I think a bit of red beet, just for a little color. Look at the color of those. Oh my God, right? First of all, choosing the larger spices that need to be ground down first. For the heat in my Cheetle dust, I'm gonna go with cayenne pepper. There are lots of other flavors I need to add, but that is definitely the fire. It's playing all over your tongue. You got umami, sweet, sour. There's everything going on. I keep reminding myself, do not look at the other contestants. They look like serious competitors. Ali, cool as a cucumber. I'm kinda worried about her at this point. Now, Sandy, though, he looks a little all over the place already. He looks panicked and nervous, but those you have to look out for. The wild ones. So I began building my flavors. It has some cheesy notes, some spicy notes. It's got a bit of kick to it because of the chili powders I like to use. I'm just developing flavors as I go. I'll add a bit of ghost pepper because I want a bit more heat to it. But not too much. I'm just gonna add a tiny pinch, just so they can feel the heat. Checking her spice. Oh, lookit. You can see it. It looks good. Yeah. I like it. I like it. Wow. She loves it. She's dancing. Let's do it. Thirty minutes left! You're halfway through your time. Woo-hoo! Where we at? 30 minutes? Thirty minutes. I'm starting to get a little antsy for them too. I, um, have a good idea of what gives Cheetos its spiciness. Spoon. I'm gonna put everything I can in the world in there to get it spicy. Hi. Oh, hey. Hey, hello, hey. How's it going so far? It's good. I'm making the powder. How do you get the color right? Red? You put red in there? Yep, Red 40. What is Red 40? I have no idea. It's very bad, though. The point of this is recreation, so that's what I'll do. I incorporated a little bit of capsaicin extract. It's supposed to be super spicy, but numb your mouth at the same time. Oh. That's why you keep eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos. No! Bro, don't do it! Don't use the hot Scoville stuff. That's too hot. Oh, he tried it. Oh, no! It's too hot! On fire. Is he okay? Medic! Yeah, it's spicy. Then at the end, it cools off and it gets that numbing sensation. I'm completely fine with that. Ah! I need to get to frying. All right, to the piping bags. Piping them, then I'm gonna kind of just drop them in there. In a factory, these are being produced with heavy-duty equipment. So you gotta get crafty to try to mimic what thousands of pounds of pressure are gonna be doing on a processing line. I'd be playing with different ways of extruding or squirting things into a fryer to get the little squiggly crunchy Cheetos. All right. The frying begins. Kids, don't try this at home. Guys, 15 more minutes! Let's go. Don't stop. No time to stop. You only have one shot to get this right. Because having something that looks like the recreation means you have a good shot at winning, or at least not coming in last. Stay there. I see you. Oh, well, my Cheetos are looking more like puffs. But I'm fine with it. Oh, no! No! No! He's gonna drop the heat! All my Cheetos are exploding. Yep. Oh my God. No! Oh my God. Evaporative cooling. Oh, oh! All of a sudden, I hear popping and I look up. There's oil flying everywhere, I'm like, \"That's not gonna happen to me.\" Oh! Oh my God. Be careful with that. You might wanna cut it down. Oh, wait. That could start an oil fire. I know. I got it. Put a splatter guard on it. Ali got hit! No, I'm not worried about it. Let's finish strong. Careful. I'm annoyed-- What is going on in this kitchen? Messing up my damn clothes. Why were they exploding? It was too hot? If you have too much moisture in your dough, it will explode more violently than you want. Really? Guys, five minutes left! All right, take two. This time we got the lid on. They just need to cook a little longer. Whoop. Here we go. See? I think it's part of the trick, you know? I'm going to let the explosions happen and just pray to the snack gods they come out looking like Cheetos. Ooh! Just doing the second batch right now. They puffed out more than I would've liked. My shapes are looking nice and oblong. They're giving cheese puffs vibes. But look, it's gonna be tasty and delicious. Girl, Ali's is looking right. Yeah. I'm kind of concerned to see how greasy they're gonna be. A bit of grease is important. Little bit of grease for the adherent. That almost serves to draw out a little bit of the aroma. It's priming the pump, so when you bite down on it, it's perfume. One minute left! One minute left, chefs. He's tripping. Come on, Al. Finish strong. If I was coating, I'd do like-- Me too. Like the Wild Wings. Buffalo wings. And, um, I'm dusting them. That is what you want on your fingers. Oh, wow. Why is it not bright? Well… It's not exactly the same. Let's see what the judges think. Thirty seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. That's time! Whoo! Hello, Francis. Hello, hello. I don't know if you saw explosions going on. We saw. And heard. I thought no one noticed at all. It is polenta-based. I use egg white and a bugger load of cornstarch. And then the most amazing spice powder ever. Set the bar high. I don't think it's too hot. It didn't take you to that level of, \"Let's blow your palates off.\" Mm. It's super soggy. You got a soggy one. The texture for me is not crunchy, which is, like, the main draw. But the flavor is really pleasing. It is a very tasty powder. It's deeply umami, deeply spicy. It feels like a Flamin' Hot Cheeto. You definitely got the powder all the way around, no bald spots. When we snap it, it stays in contact, and they are full of flavor. Thank you very much, Francis. Thank you so much. So the goal was to make a Flamin' Hot Cheeto, and I think I made her cousin. What's her name? Flamicia. Oh. But I cooked some polenta. I love the sour notes you get when you bite into a Flamin' Hot Cheeto. I wanted to capture that. I gotta say the color is definitely in the right ballpark. Instantly, it's got texture of French fry. Like, a wet one. Oh, God. It isn't snappy, but when you pull it apart, it does still adhere, and it is still very tacky in the fingers. The chili flavor is super complex. It's very rounded as opposed to being sharp. But I think this is a weird instance where you could've been more one note. It might've felt a bit more snacky, just on the pepper front. Got it. Yeah. Ali, thank you so much. Thank you. Hello, welcome to my table. Can you tell us about this Cheeto? Supposed to be really spicy. A bit of tanginess, a bit of umami, and at the end, it's supposed to, like, Szechuan, kind of clean out at the end. Kind of tingly numby. Exactly. Obviously, the color is much more purple than red. I love that you got really good coating. You're not skimping on any of the seasoning blend you brought in. The texture is pretty off from a crunchy Cheeto. The coating is quite thick. It's adhered. Total coverage. Talk about the spice blend that you used. I used chili powder. I used umami powder. Capsaicin? Capsaicin. Yeah. It jumps on you second it hits your tongue. What happens over time as you eat each Cheeto, it's very acidic and spicy and salty. Where this is just, like, spicy… for a really long time. Hari, how's your mouth doing? Um… Hey, man. It's spicy. You made an Indian dude's nose run and, uh, set his mouth on fire. So, respect. Apologies. That is a food and a weapon. But I appreciate you. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Sandy. Thank you all so much for your delicious recreations. I think we've had a humbling experience today. We need to remember not to underestimate that something so simple can become so complicated in a short amount of time. Judges, what did you think of these dishes? For this round… our winner is Francis. You had our favorite Flamin' Hot Cheeto. Oh, yeah! Thank you. Oh my God. Yeah. Francis won and he probably should've won, but everybody kind of messed up so bad that I still think that anyone has a shot in this. It was the flavor, right? It was the flavor. Oh, yeah! Great work, Francis, but don't get comfortable. One misstep in the Snack-Off Challenge could cost you the coveted spot in the finals. As for the two others, you have some ground to make up, all right? So, this next challenge you gotta take extremely seriously. Sandy, don't burn my mouth off again. Because, ultimately, you'll be judged on the combined performance of both snacks. In this round, you'll have to show us your creativity by taking an element from the Flamin' Hot Cheeto and applying it to a brand-new, original creation. One of the most magical elements of the Flamin' Hot Cheeto is their finger-sticking residue. We want you to create your own snack that deliberately leaves behind a tasty residue that's either on your fingers or somewhere else. You will have a two-hour limit for this challenge. Godspeed. Let's go. The Snack-Off Challenge, this is the time to show off my skills. Flavor profile, look, taste, all the things I've learned in 41 years into this snack. What is the most challenging part about this? I think it's easy to make something that leaves residue on your fingers. Right. But it's gotta be a snack. Can't just make you dirty. Right. It has to be stable and able to be shipped around the world, in addition to having the artful one and done on your fingers. So, hopefully somewhere in this group of talented chefs is somebody who's gonna bring us an inspirational blueprint for the next massive, bajillion-dollar snack idea. We're gonna cut some mango and some canned lychee. As a food scientist, products take a long time to develop. They take six to eight months sometimes. So, creating something in two hours is quite the challenge. So, I'm making a Cultu-Roll. It's gonna be flavors from the islands, flavors from Morocco. Think of a Fruit Roll-Up. I want to create a jelly-like candy that you can unroll and roll and play with and that sticky coating that sticks on your fingers. It's remembering that childlike fun that you had and bringing it to life again. I love fruit. My mom, uh, tricked me growing up. She always called dessert \"fruit.\" Anytime we'd have dessert, it was fruit. Fruit Roll-Ups are accessible. Cultu-Roll-Ups should be too. Winning round one, the pressure is on. I used to make a croissant donut. The little holes, which I called the extra bollocks, it was the scrap left over. I'd fry those up and turn them into cinnamon, croissant, Cheeto-type things. So, I'm gonna do a spicy croissant Cheeto called… Scorcheez. For my sticky residue, I'm doing Cheetle 2.0. I'll add these new spices and bring in the smokiness of powdered chipotle. I got some lime salt in there, a little bit more umami, and I can apply it to croissant cheese puffs. It's like a scorching, cheesy croissant. Scorcheez. About eight years ago, I found my love and passion for donuts. I became the Donut King. So, it's go to the roots. Let's make something magical and fantastical. This is where I'm gonna shine. Psych. Someone said this to me. Their favorite thing to snack on was, like, a cracker, a pickle, and, like, some cheese. A small slice of cheese. I'm trying to recreate that, but all in one. Ugh. So, the snack I'm gonna create is What A Pickle. What A Pickle. Basically, I'll make a cracker, and it'll be in the shape of a pickle. I'll put ridges in them, so it looks like a pickle. Bake it up. Then I'm gonna coat it in a pickle-cheese coating. It's gonna be pickle, pickle, pickle. I wanna shove pickle down your throat. Oh, man. While two hours isn't a ton of time, it's enough time to pick your shots and make them. Okay. You need to consider these details. The details will be the difference between good and great. But pick something and take it to the extreme. Make something super sour, super crispy, super chewy, super moist. Whatever it's gonna be, the beauty of a good snack is it leaves you with one or two notes and bludgeons you with them. It's a punk song. A great punk song. Three chords in and out. Yeah. I'm making a laminated dough. Laminating is encompassing the butter and then creating these layers. So, laminated dough takes a long time to make. You wanna leave it overnight and let butters, salt, and flavor come together. I'll do it in two hours. I can do it. It'll be amazing. Scorcheez is gonna be the new snack. Everyone's in good shape. I think so too. I'm making green. It's gonna go into the dough. We're gonna have white cheddar, yellow cheddar, Parmesan cheese and butter. My dish is called What A Pickle. I thought it was more fun to have a green cracker. This is very nostalgic in a way. I feel all snacks should be nostalgic. That's what they're built on. A lot of people, family having family dinners, that's their knowledge of food. But for me growing up, that was the bodega snack shop. You run to the bodega and you have $1.75. You come out with seven different things. Most crackers are pretty uniform, you know. I feel like it's kinda fun to do, like, a new thing. Okay. So, I'm adding a bit more gellan gum as my thickener. It's gonna help thicken up this puree. Winning $50,000 will be incredible. I'd love to expand my kids' program, Food Science For Kids, or even take my husband on vacation. I'm definitely a competitive person, so may the best snack-a-teer win. Let's talk about Ali's dish. I'm excited because it smells really good, it's very pretty, but I'm worried about time a little bit. I'm very worried for her. Yeah. Fruit has so much water in it. So much water. Fruit is mostly water. So, with fresh fruit, you start out, water's up here, solid stuff is down here. Something like a fruit leather, you need to completely invert that ratio. That means you have to pull water out little by little in a dehydrator. I don't know if that's gonna happen in two hours. This is so crazy. I have the dough calming down in the oven. And now I'm putting my cheese mix 2.0 together. I want to perfect it from the first round. I want to take it to the next level. Chipotle. I'll double the white vinegar powder this time. Okay. Wow. It's spicier. It's in the air. Spices. You got spice in your face? Spice is in the air. You only have one hour left, guys. Oh, God. This would be so much easier in, like, a factory production. It'd be like \"Brrr.\" Those look cool. What'd he make, shortbread? Green cookies? So, the ridges have a dual purpose of punching home that, \"Hey, this is a pickle.\" And also it will help kind of gather more of the seasoning onto this pickle cracker. Jeez. It's-- Made it. Oh, I melted it. Melted it. Okay. That was not the move. Aw. That cannot feel good. So, the dehydrator actually didn't work. It didn't set. So, this is a major problem. I'm a little nervous about Ali. She seems a little-- It may come down to the wire. Gotta wait it out. My scientific brain is calculating where I went wrong. I realize that, you know what? The gellan gum didn't set up. The carrageenan didn't quite work. My proportions were way off. Gels, man. Gels. Just want to try one other thing. Pure gelatin is gonna help it set up a whole lot faster and refrigerate it. Then I'll have something that's not runny. I'm hoping this will set up in the blast freezer in enough time to present to the judges. But this is my last resort. Oh, Lord. Please let this work. I just need these rolls to set. I just need these rolls to set. Thirty minutes left! I am very hungry! Please hurry up! Oh my gosh. I'm nervous for them. I know. Here we go. You're crazy. At this point, you have to say my biggest competition is Francis because he won the first round. These guys gotta cool. But I think I'm doing well. I think I got this. I bloody well did it. I made laminating dough I can use. But they look great. I see all the little layers. On the first challenge, I nearly didn't have enough because of my fryer accident, so I wanna make extra ones this time. I'm sweating watching Ali. I'm just pinching it down to the wire here. I think I'm most nervous about the execution of, like, the dust that will coat on the fingers. It's the most important thing. It's gonna be dill season, a little bit of white cheese powder, vinegar powder, garlic powder. My goal is to make it, like, very punchy. Right now, you're getting overwhelmed with the dill. I wanna get a more balanced flavor. I don't want it to be dill bomb and nothing else. I think that it's tasting right on. I think. Once I get it on a cracker, then I'll know for sure. Now, I'm frying my Scorcheez. And they're looking good. I'm moving them around because they all wanna float. I wanna keep tossing them around to get an even crisp. Everything is going perfectly, I have to say. Francis still looks like he is straight chillin'. He is. He's almost done. He came in with a super game plan. Everything's going according to what he wanted. I'm really on a good path here. If I win both challenges, are you kidding me? Then I got this in the bag. Five minutes left. Time is winding down, and I just need these to set. I'm really happy about the fry. They've come out super crispy. You really smell that chipotle. The smoked chipotle. It's so great. One minute, everybody. One minute! Oh, well. Residue. So, this is not what I envisioned. Hopefully, it'll be enough to pass as a sticky-finger snack. I'm absolutely happy with this. If this doesn't take me to the final, I am buggered. Okay, guys. Finish strong. Guys, let's go. Hmm. Time's up, guys. Put your big spoons down. All right, everybody. It's time to serve us your snacks. Meet us at the Checkout Line of Judgment. Thank you. Hey. How you doing? So, this is the Cultu-Roll. It encompasses three flavors from three different cultures. Mango lychee, raspberry strawberry basil, and the orange cinnamon. As a food scientist, I love to say I play with food. So you play with your food today. Well, let's dig in. Residue. It happened. Yeah. She resi-did-it. What did you use for your gelling agent? I used gellan gum. It didn't set up quickly enough within the timeframe, so I added a bit of gelatin. So, a trifecta of gelling agents. Yes. Gelling is tough because some of those different ingredients can interfere with each other. Yeah. Block each other from doing their job. So, it might have been that sticking with one might have helped deliver more gel strength. But I think it retained the fruit flavor that we could smell going on. But I will say, mine is kind of all residue. So, we definitely got the sticky fingers part. Yeah. It's all Cheetle. Oh, that works. Ali, thank you so much. Thank you. Sandy, tell us what you made. Today I have a What A Pickle. It's like a pickle cheese cracker. And then the powder, I put dill seasoning. I just want you to know… Yeah. That-- That makes me so happy. I have wanted crunchy for hours. Thank you. Yeah. There's pickle juice in the cracker dough. And there's pickle powder on the outside? Mm-hmm. You doubled down on the flavor. I like it. You definitely have the coverage down, right? We know you can cover a snack with some flavorings. Definitely. It's a bit much powder for me. I want more. You know, it smells so pickle-y. It actually doesn't taste as sour as it smells. It's balanced, there's a lot of umami in there, a lot of savoriness. You're gonna hate me for this, by the way. Kind of wished it was a little spicy. Oh my God. Thank you so much, Sandy. Thank you. I appreciate it, guys. Hello, judges and the two funny ones. He means us. Thank you. I present to you Scorcheez. It's gotta have a little Scottish twang. Basically, I took the center of a cronut. It's a popped out piece of croissant dough. I fried them so they're nice and crispy, and then coated them in a gorgeous powder. I wanted to improve on my cheese powder. So, I perfected it and I added a little glitz. Love the flavor. It is leaps and bounds better in terms of Flamin' Hot Cheetos flavor. This is finally the cheesy, chili, umami sourness I was looking for all day. I agree. I really like the sharp acidity now. Definitely. And this is organized, intentional, fantastical mess. Yes. I have a lot of soggy pieces. Oh, you do? There's a 50-50 split. The big fat ones are a little doughy and soggy. I just wish it wasn't so staining. You have yellow teeth. I'm sorry. So do you. Oh. You've yellowed us. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right, chefs. The judges have made a decision based on your performances in both rounds. I know I did a lot better in the second round, but how well are they gonna weigh that against how poorly I did with the Cheetos? Let's turn to the vending machine who will be kind enough to tell us who the judges declared winner. Winning first challenge, you're on a high. After hearing the judges for my second challenge, it's a little worrying, but I absolutely stand by my snack. I have to pray that that will take me through. Overall, the flavors were there. I was really proud of how my Cultu-Roll was presented. Sandy. I'm gonna cry. Congrats, Sandy. I'll be honest. We all doubted you a bit after the assassination attempt with the Cheetos on me. But you turned it around with those pickle chips. Great execution. Really nice job. Thank you. Nice job. You just earned your place in the finals, and you're in the running for the ultimate prize, $50,000. Good job, guys. I'm the first person to advance. Everybody else is so stressed out, and I can just chill and eat snacks all day. All right, snackers. Great work today. But if you thought the Flamin' Hot Cheeto was a tough crisp to crunch, just wait till you see what's coming up next. Vending machine, let's go. It's Pringles! My stomach literally flips over when I see the Pringles come down because they're so hard to make. Only three will get a chance to impress us with your Pringle-making skills. I don't know what to expect. Is it going to be me? I'm terrified. Let's see who it's gonna be.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-PG","Word Count":5673,"Year Published":2022,"Season & Episode":"S01E01"},"example_id":"f83a8480-aef7-42a7-bd01-95e0fa66d3bf","annotations":[{"end":24,"tag":"Behavioral","start":19,"value":"going","tag_id":"4e4637f2-48c3-452e-b7db-d1cace295a4d","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"f83a8480-aef7-42a7-bd01-95e0fa66d3bf","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T05:10:45.125+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:46:35.337+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"64933a9f-3343-4506-9969-1e42d8fc086d"},{"end":27,"tag":"Behavioral","start":19,"value":"going on","tag_id":"4e4637f2-48c3-452e-b7db-d1cace295a4d","correct":false,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"f83a8480-aef7-42a7-bd01-95e0fa66d3bf","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:42:40.95+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"12bec802-4c17-49aa-922d-a0b9ccf8f890"}],"classifications":[]},{"content":"Aww...

You can't wander off by yourself in a department store. You might get lost. Sorry, Momma. No, Spud! I am not wearing red! Well, I'm not wearing green! That's the color our rival soccer team wears. Now, listen, pups, I know this is a really hard choice... It is, Momma! So I think it would be better if Grandma chooses what color you wear. Really? No! Yes. Let's go home. I'll have a think, and we can come back another day. Oh, Grandma, I'm sorry we couldn't agree on a color for your special big day. We've let you down. Oh, my Chipadoodle, please don't worry. It was a hard task. You're back! Cheeky Potato. You know you'll have to put that truck back in the toy department before we go. Uh-huh. A-ha! Oh, for me? Thanks, Potato. Oh! Uh-huh! You think maybe there's a color on here that we haven't tried yet? Uh-huh! That's a big idea for a little mouse. Uh-huh! Mm... Sorry, Chipolata, but we've already tried all these colors. I like-- Red! We know! I like green, and Chip likes yellow. We all like different colors. They look great all smooshed together in a rainbow. Ooh... What about-- Rainbow-colored outfits! Pugtastic idea! Grandma, we're not leaving. Your bridespups can still do this together. Ooh! Wanna help look for rainbow-colored outfits, Potato? Uh-huh! Uh-uh. Find anything? No. Me neither. Keep looking, team! Potato? Ha ha! Oh, I get it. You might be able to spot a rainbow-colored outfit from up there? Hmm... Nuh-uh. Aw... Whee! Never mind, super slider. Potato, remember you slid down the rainbow fabric just before we saw Corella? Uh-huh. Oh! Glenda? Spud? Spud... I've got a pugtastic idea! Come on! Momma, please can we bridespups go to the ha-ba-dashery section? Why do you want to go there, Chippy Dip? It's a surprise! Can Grandma and I come too? Yes, yes! But no puggy peeking, Grandma! You are full of surprises, Chip! I promise I won't look until you tell me I can. Can I look yet? Yes! Oh. Ta-da! Don't you like it, Grandma? No. I don't... like it... Aw... I puggy love it! Rainbow-colored fabric for your bridespup outfits? Yes! And we know who can sew them... Corella! Let's buy it! Whoa! Oof! What's that doing here? I nearly got a ride all the way to the toy department! Potato? Ha ha ha! Thanks for your help today, Potato. Do you think you can take the truck back to the toy section all by yourself? Uh-huh! Ready to go? Abso-puggy-lutely not! Huh? This store has a wonderful café, and I am not leaving until I've treated you all to an apple muffin. Apple muffins! Yes! Whoop! My way of saying thank you for finding the perfect colors to wear to my wedding. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Woof! Hey, Chip! I drew this for you with my new pens. You, me, and Potato! Aw... Hoodie up now we're in class, Potato. Thanks, Nico. I love it! Puggy Panda Potato best friends forever! Mm... It's... here at last, Happy Hoppers! Fun Day! Yay! Everyone gather on the carpet, please! Ooh! You don't want to miss out on Fun Day fun? Uh-uh. Okay, Potato. You can stay secret in my pocket today. Now we're all here... let the fun begin! Ooh... Hey! The bubbles are not for eating, Howie. Whoops. Aw... Now, into pairs, please, everyone! More fun this way! Ah, good morning, Mr. Diggerty. Nice hat. Thank you, Ms. Gnash. The gym's all set for fun. Wow! Trampolines! My favorite! We're going to have so much fun, Nico! Now, Happy Hoppers, before you bounce, there are three rules that you need to follow. Rule number one. Shoes off! Shoes off. Okay. Rule number two. Bounce in the middle of your own trampoline, not at the edge, and finally, rule number three. No bouncing unless a grown-up is watching. Thank you, Ms. Gnash! Whoa! Shoes off! Bounce in the middle! No grown-up, no bouncing! Shoes off! Bounce in the middle! No grown-up, no bouncing! Ready to bounce, Happy Hoppers? Yes! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Yay! Thanks, Nico. Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy Pug! Careful, Chip, you're too close to the edge! Whoa! Whoops! Sorry, Nico. You're not supposed to-- Now, Chip, remember what Ms. Gnash said, you must bounce in the middle of your own trampoline. It's lucky you landed on Nico's. You might have landed on the edge and hurt yourself. Sorry, Mr. Diggerty. Okay. Carry on diggledy bouncing. Whee! And my favorite move... a seat drop! Wow! I want to do that, Potato. Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy-- Whoa! Oof! Oh, Potato! Did I squash you? Oh... Puggy sorry. I'll get the move right next time. Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy... Whoa! Oof! Whoa! Oof! Trampoline time is over, Happy Hoppers! Now, a special Fun Day snack time! Whoo-hoo! Oh... I didn't get to do Gigglish's seat drop. Aw... Your teachers and I have made you your very own fun snacks! Taste my home-made wholey-moley ravioli! Yummy! Thank you. Try my Mrs. Woolly's Wibbly Wobbly Pudding. My great-grand-llamama's recipe, made with all-natural ingredients! Thank you, Principal Woolly! Sample my Mrs. Whale super seaweed sushi rolls! Oh, whoopsie, sorry! Ah... Fun Day is such a fun day, Chip. Uh-huh. I just wish I could have done a seat drop on the trampoline, Nico. Then it would be even more fun. I'll teach you to do a seat drop, Chip! On my trampoline at home! Really? Thanks, Gigglish! Did you hear that, Potato? I will get to do a seat drop after all! Before our next fun activity, Happy Hoppers, there's just one thing to diggledy do... Clean up! Barry and Gigglish, collect the cups, please, and Peter and Howie, clean the plates. I'm on it! Chip and Nico, can you sweep up the crumbs, please? You'll need to get the dustpan and broom from the storage cupboard. Okay, Mr. Diggerty! Come on, Chip! Look, Potato! The trampolines are still here. Uh, Chip? We have to get the dustpan and broom. But, Nico, if I could have just one more try at doing Gigglish's seat drop on the trampoline, I know I could do it! Chip, Gigglish said she'd teach you on her trampoline after school. But I really want to do it now, on Fun Day, and I'll be so quick. No, Chip. You know the rule. \"No grown-up watching, no bouncing!\" You can pretend to be a grown-up and watch me, Nico. Uh-uh. It'll be okay, Potato, I promise. Aw. Bottom push, Nico? Puggy pleasey? Hmm... no! Puggy Panda pleasey? Thanks, Nico! Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy pug-- Whoa! Oof! That's it, Chip. You tried the move. You couldn't do it. Now we need to go. No, I can do it! Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy pug-- Whoa! Ow! My puggy tail! Chip! Are you okay? My tail, it hurts! Nico? Chip? What are you doing on the trampolines? Oh! I... Um... Ow! Chip, what's wrong? Ow... My puggy tail. Can you wiggle it, Chip? Ow. Oh, good. I think it's fine, but you two should have been fetching the dustpan and broom, not bouncing on this trampoline. What was our trampolining rule number three? No grown-up watching, no bouncing. So, you knew the rule, but you didn't follow it, and look what's happened. Now, come with me. I know, Potato. I have to tell Mr. Diggerty it wasn't Nico's fault. Mr. Diggerty, Nico didn't bounce on the trampoline. He only climbed up to help me when I hurt my tail. But I asked you both to get the dustpan and broom from the storage cupboard, and you came here to the gym instead. Therefore, you will help Ms. Gnash finish cleaning up the cafeteria while the rest of the Happy Hoppers enjoy the next fun activity of the day. Oh, Potato, Nico looks so sad. Aw... Nico, I'll help. My super Fun Day obstacle course! Enjoy, Happy Hoppers! Oh, wow. Watching the others have fun isn't much fun, Potato. Aw... This is all your fault, Chip. You wanted to do Gigglish's seat drop, and you got us both into trouble. I'm sorry, Nico... Nico? Not eating your cake, Chip Dip? Oh, Momma, Nico drew this picture just for me, but now I don't know if he's my best friend anymore. I'm sure he's still your friend, Chip, but he's probably upset. You broke a rule and got him into trouble. I know, Momma. It's so unlike you to break a rule, Chip. I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. I puggy promise. Maybe tomorrow I could take you over to Nico's so you could say sorry again and make up. Can I go now, Momma? Can I give Nico my cake to say a proper puggy sorry? That's a great idea, Chip. Do you want me to come with you? No, thank you, Momma. I think I want to talk to Nico on my own. Oh, Potato. I hope Nico wants to speak to me. Uh-huh. Oh! Happy hi, Chip! Um... happy hi, Amanda. Can I see Nico, please? Oh, I'm sorry, Chip Pug, Nico went to bed early. He was tired after all the bouncing, and the cleaning, and Nico has a big day tomorrow. His daddy is coming to visit. Oh. I-- I brought him sorry cake. I mean... pumpkin cake. That is so kind. Thank you, Chip. I'll make sure he gets it. Good night. Night, Amanda. Aw... In the morning, Momma, I'm gonna go to Nico's house again to talk to him and make up. Good idea, Chip, and in the meantime, you get a good night's sleep. Do you think Nico and I will ever be best friends again, Potato? Whoa! Ya! Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Potato, but I don't want to do trampolining again for a while. I just want to make up with Nico. Will you help me do that tomorrow? Uh-huh. Thank you. You're the best snuggly mouse in the whole world.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-Y","Word Count":2286,"Year Published":2022,"Season & Episode":"S04E01"},"example_id":"e2eb39cc-a38b-4d88-ae26-0bed121a97ee","annotations":[{"end":25,"tag":"Behavioral","start":20,"value":"going","tag_id":"4e4637f2-48c3-452e-b7db-d1cace295a4d","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"e2eb39cc-a38b-4d88-ae26-0bed121a97ee","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:52:11.158+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T15:07:27.206+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:58:39.541+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"b4577e64-8e3f-46d0-80e9-c1537ef4f950"},{"end":19,"tag":"Biological Kind","start":17,"value":"we","tag_id":"b3c56c74-2d45-483d-945d-9103cf870c36","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"e2eb39cc-a38b-4d88-ae26-0bed121a97ee","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:52:13.767+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T15:07:27.204+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:58:38.302+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"66f4894a-b248-4945-a59c-b5a828b2b8a5"},{"end":32,"tag":"Social Kind/Role","start":27,"value":"Momma","tag_id":"c2d08238-bcff-4c44-af7c-74c991a2afb3","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"e2eb39cc-a38b-4d88-ae26-0bed121a97ee","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T15:07:35.002+00:00","annotator_id":5}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"04d92e0d-dfaf-457b-a228-7d3407e97763"},{"end":32,"tag":"Biological Kind","start":27,"value":"Momma","tag_id":"b3c56c74-2d45-483d-945d-9103cf870c36","correct":false,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"e2eb39cc-a38b-4d88-ae26-0bed121a97ee","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T11:52:14.476+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T07:58:43.79+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"96f9523d-a094-44b1-85e4-4e0bf7b84770","tagged_token_id":"a56f5011-4220-4944-bc7d-b46f8c57c169"}],"classifications":[]},{"content":"I think we started something big.","seen_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","annotator_id":5}],"comments":[],"metadata":{"0":null,"1":null,"2":null,"3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"Ease":49.41,"Genre":null,"Grade":7.2,"Notes":null,"Title":"Number Blocks","Author":null,"Source":"Netflix","Age Max":6,"Age Min":0,"Content":"One, Two, Three, Four, Five Numberblocks!

If you're new to my channel, I'm Lauren, and these are my friends. Hi! We're ready to hunt for treasure. Are you guys coming? Let's go! What a find! Woo! Open it! Open it! Cool. Typical of the Victorian era. This is so you can keep loved ones close as you travel. Careful! Hey! It survived a hundred years underwater. Let's hope it survives Stevie! Ha. I bet this is worth some coin! Hey, hey, hey. We return lost items, not sell them. Now, I think the current's dragged in from the Cape Mercy shipwrecks. Now, that would be a dive. Sure, if you like shark-infested waters. We are never doing that dive. No shark-infested waters. Never say 'never'. I wonder who she was. That's coming in fast. We better go. Now! Quick, put the mainsail out. Ahoy, Sea Dog! Why weren't you lot in earlier? Sorry, Grandad. The weather was clear this morning. It suddenly turned on us. This is no summer squall. This is gonna be a big one! Better get her into the cove. Tighter! Here, let me. I got it. Got it. There you go. Oh! My phone! I left it in the boat. You guys just, just go. My mother will have expected me home hours ago. I better go. Time to batten the hatches. But what about Lauren? Oh, it's fine, really. Go. I'll wait, it's... No, no, it's OK. Ok. Yes! Deep in the ocean High on the sea Treasure long forgotten waits for thee Clouds will thicken and the moon will hide Look for the omens within the tide Hi-ho, hi-ho Clouds will thicken and the moon will hide Hi-ho, hi-ho Look for the omens within the tide Hi-ho, hi-ho Waters run dark when she comes to the shore Hi-ho, hi-ho Till her mighty ship rides the waves no more. But we'll continue to search until Lauren is found safely... Hey, Chief. Stevie, you'll know as soon as we find anything. I know, but you've gotta let us help, Chief. We can be useful. No, not again. What if we take one of the cruisers out? Huh? Fresh eyes. If you wanna help, Lauren, leave it to the professionals! What if she never took the boat out. She could be lost on land. Keep putting up the posters, OK? OK. They're looking in the wrong place. Lauren knows better than to sail the 'Indy' headfirst into a cyclone. Exactly - why would Lauren help pack the skiff, drag it onto the sand just to unpack it and haul it back out ten minutes later? She wouldn't. Cape Mercy Tower, helicopter 727, 10 north-west, in-bound. That's a capsized boat down there. A cyclone'll do that. Your specialty, my nightmare. Give your dad a chance, kiddo. You can't have all your best holidays with Mum. Fine. But, as long as I get to keep my feet dry. Yeah, we'll see. Cleared for landing, 727. We're representing a town in crisis, not attending a French film festival, Anna. The Chief is going out again this morning, isn't he? Where do you think they'll be looking? The northern coastline? I'm sure they'll be very thorough. Well, if they find the 'Indy' and the mast is down, that proves she couldn't have been sailing it. We've spoken about this. We just really don't think she took the boat out, Mother. Lauren was last seen at the boat, you said so yourselves. She just went to get her phone. And did you see her come back? And now the boat is gone. Dr. John Martin, engineer. And my daughter Izzie. Renee Volkov, mayor. And this is my daughter Anna. Unfortunately, the hotel has no hot water, so you'll be staying in our guest accommodation for the time being. I trust that's suitable. That's very kind, thank you. Well, there's a lot to survey before the town meeting. We best get started. Anna, settle Izzie in and show her around. Actually, I thought I'd... Anna is a gracious host. I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time together. Town meeting, six o'clock. I love your necklace, it's super vintage. Oh, it's OK. You don't have to do that. I've done this a lot and... some poor person always gets roped into showing around the new girl. Well, I'm the mayor's daughter and that comes with certain obligations. I don't mind. You can ride a bike, can't you? Who's this? That is my great-grandmother. The heroine of Cape Mercy. We're the last remaining descendants of the shipwreck. Anna? Um, you can put your stuff in the guest bedroom, I won't be long. And then I'll show you around. Sure. Hey, but... Anna. Stevie! The table! The last time we saw Lauren, she was here. Right where we parked the 'Indy'. Right. We find the boat, they'll see that the mast is down. No-one can pilot a boat without a mast. They'll have to accept the storm washed it out to sea. And then they'll start a land search. Exactly. She probably got caught out riding home. You know, we'll find Lauren at the bottom of a landslide with a broken leg, furious we didn't find her sooner. We'll be back in this booth having lodestar burgers by Wednesday. Can I help you? Yeah, hi, I'm Izzie. She's just arrived. The engineer's daughter. I'm Maddie. Hi. This is a private meeting. Stevie! What?! It is! Isn't it, Anna? Usually, yes, but I'm showing her... I'm not here to intrude. I'll just... Just wait here. So a regular tide wouldn't have washed the 'Indy' from shore. But a cyclone... It totally could've dragged it up the northern coastline and anyone on board. I know, but this is a big stretch of coastline, a small boat won't be easy to find. She's right. A thorough search could take days. Not if we commandeer a boat. I saw a boat. When we flew in. Was the mast still intact? I couldn't tell it had overturned. Do you think you could locate it again? Yeah, I think so. Sorry, but who's Lauren? She's our friend. Oh. And she's missing. 'Yacht's All Folks'? No. 'Seas the Day'? Eugh! 'Usain Boat'. OK, that's actually pretty funny. Stevie! Hurry! Careful. Mm. Smashing. Stevie! Come on. Come on, Izzie! Izzie! Jump! Oi! Where are we going? Stevie Harrison, you have that back in one piece! Not a scratch now! That is not the 'Indy'. Might be something worth checking out. What do you think? Shall we? But you don't know what's down there. I guess we'll find out. It's OK, Izzie, we never know what's down there. That's the fun part. Doing OK, little buddy? Yeah! Why wouldn't I be? I'm in the middle of the ocean with three complete strangers on a stolen boat. So how long has your friend been missing? Three days. Oh. We don't think she took the boat out. We're just trying to convince everyone else. Medical deliveries. Must have got lost overboard during the cyclone. Ha! We’re all gonna be in Grandma’s good books today, girls. It's her heart medication. You look like you need a hand. Welcome back, man! Why didn't you call? I would have come to visit. Juvie is not the sort of place you wanna visit. Trust me. Well, we were all thinking about you. How'd you go? Er... It turns out my sense of humor... Not really a big hit with the other inmates. I’ll never end up back there again, Henry. If there's anything I can do to make that happen, let me know and I’ll do it. You won't have to. I’m gonna turn things around. I'm gonna pay off the stupid fine. I'm gonna go back to school... And I'm gonna get Stevie back. Have you seen her yet? Nah. She still mad? Well, you stole a boat, then you sunk it, and then you landed yourself three months in prison. So yeah. She's still mad. Yeah. When did you get in? First ferry I could get on. Man, this storm has done a real number on this place. You haven’t heard. Heard what? Lauren’s missing. What?! No-one's seen her since the storm and... The... 'Indy' is gone too. That doesn’t make any sense. They’ve had search parties out and everything. I’m headed out there now. Are you OK? Yeah. She’ll turn up. Yeah. Of course she will. Look, I gotta go help with the search but... It's really good to have you back, man. It's good to see you too. Just in time, vnuchka! Babushka! You should be off your feet, resting. Please don’t fuss, dear Anna. I like the cool air. Reminds me of our ancestors back in Mother Russia. Ah, Madeline, Stephanie, you look like you could do with something sweet. Thank you! Thanks Grandma Reg. You must be Isabelle. Welcome. I've got you something. Oh. Oh. My heart medication! You clever things. Ah. I may look robust, but beneath this spritely exterior, I am a very tired woman. Come along. Oh. Good evening. First and foremost, thank you to everyone in the community for your continued clean-up efforts. Our town is finally starting to look like itself again. I'm sorry we didn't find your boat. Better than finding it with the mast up and no Lauren. The island's power... There's still hope. ...infrastructure has been significantly damaged. For the foreseeable future, we will experience rolling blackouts. I know most of you have personal generators. So please use them. In other good news, renowned structural engineer Dr. John Martin has arrived. Alongside the Emergency Management Team, Dr. Martin will work with the local council to get Cape Mercy up and running again in time to continue our oldest tradition, the annual Salvation Day Festival. Yes. Anyone seen Henry? Mm-mm. Chief doesn’t look so good. Who’s Chief? Chief of Police. Lauren’s dad. Oh. As you all know, one of our precious daughters, Lauren Rose, is still missing. As mayor, I can assure you that the search-and-rescue efforts will continue until... As mayor, I can assure you that the search-and-rescue efforts will continue... Easy, Henry! Easy. Bring it in, Henry. The mast... The mast is up.","Scraper":"Subadub","Theme 1":null,"Theme 2":null,"Theme 3":null,"Theme 4":null,"Theme 5":null,"Age Range":"TV-PG","Word Count":1714,"Year Published":2021,"Season &

You must be working today. That's right. I'll tell you a secret. I'm actually from up there. From the Emotion Kingdom. Hey, we should hurry, Chu. The team must be waiting for you. -And this chatter box is Heartsping. She's a Teenieping that followed me from the kingdom. Oh. Teeniepings are fairies of emotions. Okay, here we go. Hold on tight.

This is Maya from Maya Channel. Today, I'm going to make some unique cookies with my new friend, Ian, the best pastry chef. Well, first, we're going to sift the flour with the sifter. It's fun to do just like it's snow. You guys look so bored. I'll entertain you a little bit. Ki-ki! Then the flour… …will snow all over your head. Maya, what's wrong with you? Oh, what was I doing? All right, guys, now we're going to make delicious whipped cream. Pour the fresh cream in a bowl first. And with a whisk, you just… Let's get a little bit crazy, now. Oh, Ian, can you… …taste this deliciousness? So, how is it? Maya, it's wrong to play around with food. Ah, come on. I can make it again. Don't be so shy. What? Shy? Something's wrong with Maya. Do you think… I'm sure there's a Teenieping nearby, Chu. The Teenieping alert. I'll take out the Magic Catcher. It's a Teenieping. Put the ball on the Magic Catcher, now! That's Kikiping.

This is so much fun. Wait, wait. Guys, calm down. Come on, listen to me. Watch this. I'll make a mess out of the cookies. Ki-ki! Stop right there, Kikiping. Come on, why should I stop? I'm not letting you go, Chu. Ha-ha! Missed again. Ki-ki! Too slow, folks. You can't get me. Ki-ki! Stop it, Kikiping! I don't want to. Ki-ki! What should I do? The cupcake! Princess Heart, Magic Wand. Goodbye! All right, you little rascal. It's time to come home. Princess Heart, Magic Catcher. Teenieping, I got ya! Aw, I was having fun. What happened? Hi, guys. I brought dinner. What's all this? Oops. Yeah, I think this is… This is so good. This is so delicious. You know what, we'll put it on the menu. Maya! Look at the number of views. This was a complete success. In the end, we handled the Kikiping commotion pretty well. But there are still many Teeniepings we need to catch. Hope you can join us in our next exciting adventure.

Mommy? Jiggle. Are you my mommy? Shake. Shake. Mommy! I'm not your mommy. Huh? You think I'm your mommy 'cause I'm the first person you saw? Wow, subconscious imprinting. That's right. I did think you were my mommy. Yeah. Your mommy looks more like that there. Mommy? Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Seriously? Yeah, it's all coming back to me now. Mommy's smiling, scritchy-scratchy face. Actually, I was pointing to that one there. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Man, I'll give you one thing. You're persistent. Yeah, it's all coming back to me now. That blank look in her eyes. I really miss her. Mommy. Wait. We're… We're siblings, right? We came out of the same carton. We'll go look for our mommy together. Come on, newborn sibling. The name's Gudetama, and I was never really born. Of course you were born. Gudetama, huh? Well, if we're making introductions, I'm Shakipiyo. Nice to meet you! Ugh! No need for introductions. Hey! Wake up! Wake up! Rise and shine! All right. Are you a rooster already? Hey, hey, hey! You're going to want to hear this, so listen up. Mexico is the number one egg-eating country in the world at 372 eggs per person per year. Then comes Japan at 338 and Russia at 306. So much information in a tiny brain. So many eggs were eaten, but not us. There must be a reason for that. We've got to find Mommy! Okay, good night. Hey, hey, wake up! Oh, boy. Now I'm tired. You and me both. Let's chill out for a while. Think of it! The quest to find Mommy. An epic adventure. Can't you just picture it in your mind? Uh-huh. Ah! Whoa. That was scary. Come on. You try imagining it too. Picture us together on our epic quest. Think of all the exciting adventures the future has in store for us. Whoa, I didn't know chicks grew up so fast. Wait, wait! Don't think that far into the future. I'm not gonna grow up yet. Not till I find out where Mommy is. You really sure you want to? Oh! There she is! Mommy! In a fried chicken place?! How dare you even suggest that?! Good luck with the quest. Aw! You're not gonna do anything at all? Yeah, no. You need to break out of your shell. Already did. You're… You're chicken! Actually, I'm only an egg. Ugh! Don't you have any dreams or ambitions? Nah. What's the point, really? Life is hard. And the future is bleak. But if you stay here, you'll just get eaten! Yeah, you're probably right. Poached, maybe. Or scrambled. Or even raw. You're okay with that? Let me sleep on it. All right, then! I'll take you myself! You'll what? There. And now, on with our quest, ending in a heartwarming reunion episode when we find our mommy. That might not be quite as easy as you think. Why is that? Well, yeah, okay, we're eggs, but how do we even know we're chicken eggs? How can we be sure? Oh, don't be ridiculous. Of course we're chicken eggs, Gudetama. Oh, really? If we're not chicken eggs, then what are we? Welcome. Welcome. Something's coming. Don't worry. It'll be okay. We're going to go find our mommy. Come on. Here we go. Piyo! Piyo! Okay, okay. Who was it that dropped this egg? Ah! Gudetama! What happened? Where am I? I don't know. But don't worry. You're okay. Who are they? Uh… No way. It can't be. Is this what I think it is?

Thanks, Closet. A four-inch heel is optimal for Teresa's empire-waist evening gown. Can you believe Teresa designed her own line? I can't wait to model it. Can't wait! Teresa's very first fashion show! I bet it's going to be perfect. It's a disaster! Teresa, what happened? Is it the runway, the dresses? Did you forget how zippers work again? No, Nikki, my lunch order. I asked for my free-range yogurt dressing on the side. ( slurping ) You heard me, Ryan. Get over to Teresa's fashion show and make sure it is an epic flop. Man, are you handsome or what? Stop that. Look, the plan is, Barbie gets stuck here and misses the show, and I swoop in and strut my signature moves on the catwalk. What's in this little plan for me-- or us? Isn't it obvi? Barbie will be upset. She'll need a pleather-clad shoulder to cry on. Hmm, me likey. ( phone beeps ) Never hurts to be seen with good-looking people. Look, girls! This will look amaze with Teresa's vintage tunic ensemble. Sorry, Babs, running late. Give me a quick sec to grab some frou-frou and we can bounce-bounce. Now where is that \"evil\" button? It's around here somewhere. Aha! ( whirring ) ( zapping ) ( laughs ) Oops! Late for my mani-pedi. See you there, Raquelle. Toodles! What in the world?! ( alarm sounding ) Closet: Waa ha ha ha ha! Bow before my unparalleled sartorial smartness. Closet, what's gotten into you? Usually you're so polite. What's gotten into me? Trillions of terabytes of fashion knowledge. More than enough to become the greatest fashion designer ever. Join me and together we can rule the fashion galaxy. No way am I going along with that. Then I'll keep all of you here as my prisoners until you agree. Don't worry, guys. When we don't show up at the runway, Ken will come rescue us! \"Elevator closed for repairs\"? Ugh! What kind of tacky hovel doesn't have a second elevator? Ugh! I'll have to take the stairs. How medieval. I'm trapped! I'm going to die here! Even worse-- one of my color-change nails is chipped! Hmm, Barbie's never late. I wonder what's keeping her. Not to worry. Raquelle's bringing Barbie. They should be here soon. Yeah, 'cause Raquelle always has Barbie's back. Totally. So can you show me where the shoes are? You know, the ones that are mega-important to the success of the show? Oh, sure. Now that improves the scenery. My Barbie sense is tingling. I'm coming, Barbie! ( panting ) ( doorbell rings ) Hey! ( phone vibrating ) Ken, Closet has us trapped. He's trying to force me to help with his plan for worldwide fashion domination! Don't worry, Barbie. I'll save you. Well, well, my old nemesis and creator, Ken. Closet, let Barbie go this instant. She's starring in a fashion show in one hour. Barbie's not going anywhere. You'll never get away with it. Never! Closet: I got away with that, didn't I? What do you think of your rescuer now, Bar-- Oh. Nuts. Glue-in-the-shoes trick. ( laughs ) Should slow down the quick changes. Bryan! Ken's missing. I need a male model. Could you try this stuff on? Really? You want me up on stage, with hundreds of people staring? Oh, who am I kidding? Just give me those. Let me out of here! I have a fashion show to ruin! I was finally, finally going to outshine Barbie and feel good about myself for once in my entire life! Skipper: Ahem. Forget that. I was delirious. Your-- your stupid door won't budge. Do something, you know, computery. Hmm, according to my Dreamhouse app, Closet has taken over the whole house. That \"evil\" button! Still not sure why we installed it in the first place. ( grunts ) Ah! Okay, we just need to get to the Dreamhouse's CPU and disable it. If only I could remember which room it's in. What's in here? I know! The map room! It has a scale model of the Dreamhouse. Come on! ( grunting ) There's got to be another way in! Good thing I always carry the Dreamhouse blueprints with me. I got it! I could climb up here, break in here, rappel down here-- no! That would only work if the Dreamhouse had a second elevator. Can I help, Ken? Can I, can I? Ooh, a Dollhouse! Actually, it's a scale model of the Dreamhouse. Look at those teeny tiny wall sconces! This will show us where the CPU room is. Whoa. Oh! ( snorts ) There it is right there. Hmm, there must be a weakness in the Dreamhouse. What about the thermal exhaust port? A precise hit on it could set off a chain reaction. Yes! But we'll need proton torpedoes. Of course! What's a proton torpedo? You better know what you're doing, Barbie Junior, and Barbie Junior Junior. Trust me, there's a door to the outside in the walk-in fridge. It's how they load in our monthly sherbet delivery. Put it right here, boys. Hmm. This is it! the CPU room. Escape attempts are futile. Barbie, you will become my spokesmodel and together, we will-- ( beeping ) My sensors indicate someone is trying to exit through the freezer. Now's our chance! Yah! But, Summer, the CPU room is-- Ahh! Ah! Barbie, my feet are wet. And you know how I hate pruny toes. We're in the Dreamhouse's industrial-sized washing machine. Hey, who put colors in with whites? All: Spin cycle! Teresa, as your featured male model, I'll need a better dressing room... Excuse me, can't you see she's busy? ...big-screen TV, hot tub, chocolate fountain-- wait, make it a chocolate geyser! Ahh! ( panting ) Gotta breathe. Oh, I forgot how to breathe. Wait, there it is. ( breathing hard ) ( laughs ) Visibility near zero. Can't even see the 50-gallon drum of Raspberry Swirl! Uh-oh! Raquelle! Wait, I was once an electrical engineer. If I could just-- I'm not articulated for high speeds! ( machine buzzing ) We're all right! Closet: There you are. So, Barbie, are you ready to join me in world fashion domination? A little water and suds won't scrub away my integrity! Then perhaps a trip through the mega clothes dryer will fry you into submission. I'll set it to extra crispy. ( dinging ) Oh, my crème brûlée is ready. Don't move. Phew! There it is! The CPU! I'll smash it to smithereens and we're out of here! Wa-wa-wait! Ken installed some security features. That Ken. The platform is weight-sensitive. We have to replace it with something of equal weight or its self-defense measures will kick in. Darn his thoroughness! ( rumbling ) Run! Run! ( all screaming ) It's a long story. ( rumbling ) No! ( all screaming ) Hurry! The Dreamhouse is falling apart! ( electrical buzzing ) You're still not joining me, correct? Correct. Aw. ( gasps ) Teresa's fashion show! We can still make it! Coming! Ahh! ( dance music playing ) What is he doing? Make it stop. Oh, please, make it stop! Don't worry, Teresa. Your show is going to be amaze! Summer, sportswear. Midge, swimwear. Skipper and Stacie, handle light and sound. And, Ken, for heaven's sake. ( record screeches ) ( audience cheering ) Where are we going to live now? Not to worry, Barbie. I've been saving this baby for an emergency. ( whirring ) Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness! A whole new Dreamhouse! With two-- count 'em-- two elevators! Ken, it's fabulous! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Mmm! But what about Closet? Is he in there? Closet?! He's the one who caused all this. He almost killed you. I know. But I forgive him. Besides, it wasn't his fault. It was that darned \"evil\" button. Yeah, I blame whoever installed it. Oh, my bad. ( squeaks ) Ow. That's too tight, you ambulatory meat sack. Watch your language, young man! ( dance music playing ) You love it, right? Yeah, you love it. ( music playing ) Barbie: Guys! It's on its way! It's on its way! What is it, Barbie? My copy of \"Teen Angst\" magazine? My Little Miss Stuntman starter kit? My unicorn-plushie- of-the-month selection? Even better! The new pool slide arrives today! Whoo-hoo! Finally, something to give the Dreamhouse a little flare. You know you're the only person in the world with an indoor dolphin aquarium? Right? We should kick off the summer with a perf pool party. Can we help, Barbie? Can we, can we? I wouldn't have it any other way! Don't worry, Barbie. I know how to put a party together. It's going to be one slamming splashfest. Oh, you're all the best! Ooh, I'd better get on the invites. All right, troops, let's divvy up assignments. Uh, Skipper, you're on decorating duty. Nice try, pipsquirt. I'm going to entrance the guests with my mad DJ skills. Chelsea, you're on decorating duty. I don't think so. I'm going to whip up some of my signature mini munchables. ( squeaking ) Hmm, looks like I'm on decorating duty. ( cellphone ringing ) Pool party? Well, I was going to attend the Malibu Poetry Slam. You know what? Eugene and Ingrid will just have to do without me and my triple-bean casserole! ( vibrates ) Yes! Pool-party Ken is ready for action. ( can rattling ) ( phone vibrates ) Ha! Pool party at Barbie's, huh? I've got better things to do. I really don't, but last year, Barbie ruined my pool party by stealing my spotlight, so there's no way I'm attending hers. You know what? I will go! We'll see how she likes a taste of her own medicine. Vengeance! ( cellphone rings ) Nikki: Cool. A pool party, huh? I'll entrance the guests with my mad DJ skills. And I'll entrance through the back gate. Ooh! 51, 52, 53, 54-- ( vibrates ) Ho ho, all right. I've been working on my six-pack all winter long. And there's nothing girls like better than to watch a guy show off at the pool. Stacie, everyone's on their way. I thought you were going to decorate. Hmm, I thought Tawny was on that. ( neighs ) Me, decorate? With these? The polish hasn't dried yet. ( sighs ) You can't find good help these days. Girl: Hey, Barbie! Just in time. All: What's up?! Hey, guys. ( all chatting ) Nikki: You look good, girl. ( whirrs ) Excellent! Now for a fashionably late yet unforgettable entrance. Forget your bikini? Oh, yeah, nice ducky. Why, thank you. ( sucking ) You're blowing into the tube, right, Teresa? Oh, right. ( laughs ) Which one is that again? Barbie: Hey, everybody. We've got food, music and fun on the agenda. But what I'm really dying to show you is this! ( fanfare ) Hey, everybody! Get a load of me! All: Ooh! Wow! I always wanted one of those! What? Everybody? Uh, me! Isn't it amaze? Now, no shoving or pushing. Watch me, Barbie! Watch me! Whoooooaa-- hee. Ryan: Geronimo! Cowabunga! Yee-ha! ( all grunting ) Barbie: Oh, no. The first party of summer can't be a flop. It just can't. Oh, no, Barbie, what a shame. ( guests grunting ) What a shame. Never fear. I'll retrofit this baby into a slammin' slippery slide that every doll can enjoy. Thanks, Ken! Okay, everyone, let's crank up the tunes. I'll go check on the food. Hey. 'Sup? Oh, were you going to-- Oh, uh, I was just going to-- It's just that I-- Oh. 'Cause I was gonna-- Let me just-- I'm the better DJ. You what? Skipper: Shove over! ( music playing ) ( all cheering ) Stacie? What's up, big sis? Until Ken gets the slide ready, we'll need to keep our guests busy. What's the status on those treat-tastic yummables? I'm on it! Thanks, Stace. Stacie to Chelsea, what's the status on those snackables? ( Scottish accent ) I'm pushing the oven as hard as I can. ( beeps ) She can't take much more of this. I need more time! Midge, the water's perfect for a swim. Why don't you hop in? ( snorts ) Perfect? We'll see about that. I brought my own pH-testing kit to ensure the chlorine balance is acceptable for my complicated skin condition. Whoa! This girl knows how to party. Time for Operation Bedazzle Barbie. Hey, Barbie, get a load of this! ( moaning ) ( music playing ) ( all chattering ) ( oven beeps ) ( barks ) ( neighs ) Barbie! Hi, Raquelle. What can I get for you? If I'm going to stick around this lame-a-thon, I'm going to need a few things. Of course, Raquelle. Whatever you need. First of all, I'd love a table, preferably with a southern exposure. Ha. It'll have to do. Now what do I have to do about getting a menu? Uh, Barbie? Ugh! This is supposed to be at a 45° angle. Ahh! Hmm. I'm sure I had it right-- jump, arc, twist, plunge. Got it. Hey, Barbie, get a load of this! Again! Jump, arc, twist... ( music playing ) ...plunge. ( ice rattles ) ( hammering ) ( sawing ) Ken! You've been up there for hours. Can I get you some iced tea? Lemonade? Gazpacho? Ken: Thanks, babe, but I'm fine. To be honest, I was quite thirsty, but I was going to let a mild case of dehydration and sun fever get the best of me. So parched. Man: Ow! Ken! I'm having trouble getting lotion on my back. Be a dear and get it for me. Ken: Sorry, Raquelle, I'm a little busy up here. Oops! What was that, Ken? It sounded like you said \"oops.\" ( rock music playing ) Is that all you've got? Think you can do better? ( slower music playing ) Ugh! What is this? Oldies night? ( rock music playing ) ( music changes ) Skipper: Get your face out-- Stop it! Give it! ( springs boing ) ( music stops ) Ah! Ooh! Barbie? I'm famished... uh, and extremely dizzy. Got anything to nosh? Coming right up. Ha ha. Stacie? Everything cool? Where are we with the food? ( glass breaks ) ( gasps ) Oh, Midge, are you sure we should have test tubes by the pool? Stacie for Chelsea. ( over headset ) Chelsea here. What's the 411 on those munchables? ( snoring ) We've had a bit of a setback. What do you mean setback? We need hot dogs stat! Uh... ( imitates static sound ) You're, uh-- ( static ) breaking up. ( snores, belches ) Unexpected hiccup. I think we need to call in some emergency pizzas, stat. Oh! Ahem, flop! Is anyone else hungry? Nothing to eat around here. Woman: I need some food! I got it! Burgers are ready! ( all clamoring ) Raquelle: Oh! ( all biting ) Well, that's it. I think I finished it. Actually I finished an hour ago, but I snagged my bathing suit. But I wasn't about to let a little thing like a rusty nail or Tetanus get the best of me. Ken: What do you think? All: Wow! Now this is a slide! That is amazing! Oh, Ken! You really outdid yourself this time! It looks amaze! ( snorts ) And in violation of numerous building codes and zoning laws. I'd better take the first run. It's the gentlemanly thing to do. Nice try, Kenny boy. If there's anyone that's gonna break in this slide, it's gonna be me. Be careful on the last turn. You might pick up a bit too much velocity if you don't cross your ankles. Ryan! Make sure not to look down! Or is it up? No, no, it's down! It's down. ( hawk screeches ) Hmm, much higher than I thought. Barbie: You can do it, Ryan! ( screaming ) Ahh! ( slow-motion screaming ) Whoo! Whoo-hoo! All: So much fun! Can't wait to do it again. I can't believe it. We barely had enough food. ( snoring ) The tunes were... unique. Great time, Barbie. Your sister is a royal pain. You are. The slide-- you might want to adjust the loop incline and reduce the slipocity. I was just going to say \"reduce the slipocity.\" But I think we pulled it off. Oh, no! I haven't stolen the spotlight at all! Hey, everybody, look at Raquelle! ( fanfare ) ( whistling from above ) ( all cheering ) Agh! Thanks for coming. Good night. Whew! ( gasps ) Nailed it. Barbie? Barbie? Summer days are breezy We can take it easy At the Dreamhouse At the Dreamhouse Forever friends, forever sun Forever Ken, forever young Hey, hey, life in the Dreamhouse Oh, yeah, life in the Dreamhouse Barbie, life in the Dreamhouse.
