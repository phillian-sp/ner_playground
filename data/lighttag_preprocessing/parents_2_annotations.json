Barbar visits another planet. the weather is beautiful in the country of the elephants. they've all decided to go on a picnic. suddenly Arthur looks up and exclaims. look. a rocket behind the palm trees. I can see it. it's going to land. but Babar only laughs at him. come one Arthur you're only dreaming. oh wait a minute. you're right. it is a real rocket. it's coming towards us. the rocket lands close beside them with a noise. what's going on. suddenly a strong wind picks the elephants up like feathers and sucks them right into the cabin of the rocket. the door closes before they have time to realize what is happening to them. the rocket carries them off into space. what is this doing. yeah. this thing is a um machine in the middle of the rocket and it hands them little biscuits and candy for them to eat. Pom Flora and Alexander eat some biscuits held out to them by an automatic arm. what an adventure. moans Celeste. the trip is long. oh what is it doing here. off what. oh. yeah he lost his shoe. this maybe this planet is made of caramel. you know what caramel is. it's like candy. it's very sticky. look some of the inhabitants are approaching. do you know what inhabitants are. what. they're the people who live there. see them. driven by some strange looking people a fleet of skimmer craft draw near the rocket. what. yeah they look just like elephants. they look like shrunken up little elephants. Babar calls to Celeste come and see the inhabitants of this soft planet. they look like elephants yet they're not elephants. hm. what do you think they are. long what. right long trunks and long ears just like elephants. the strange fellows invite Babar and Celeste to get in next to them. then they take them to some platforms where they moor their craft. next some flying eggs float down from the sky and the curly eared elephants seat themselves on small stools hung beneath. quick said Babar let's follow them. these flying eggs rise high in the sky. a city appears hanging in the air from enormous balloons. lightly and silently it floats above the soft planet. this planet is amazing isn't it Zephyr. oh what is this Shem. you go up the ladders and you slide down. why. mm. but what are these little eggs doing. floating to do balloon. oh I hope he doesn't pop them. oh dear. they land gently on a terrace. the natives rush up to look at them. one wearing a pointed hat approaches Babar and makes an interminably long speech while another wearing a hat shaped like a mushroom smiles nearby. of course Babar doesn't understand a word but he guesses that Mister Pointed Hat is inviting him to visit the town. see they follow them and slide down the ladders and go into different places in the town. yeah. they come out_of this little egg thing. in the house belonging to Pointed Hat and Blue Mushroom there is a swimming+pool in the living+room. truly says Arthur these elephants with curly ears know how to live. Flora has no desire to plunge into the pool. she has found a friend a little dog with blue spots. where's that little dog Shem. does that look like a regular dog. no it doesn't. look what are those funny things on its head. wrinkles. that looks like it has four ears. and what is this little guy doing. but isn't that kind of a funny looking jumping place. oh yeah. in the evening they are shown to their bed+rooms. these are little wall niches. see they fit into the wall. Babar and Celeste are too big to fit into them so Blue Mushroom orders the pool emptied and filled with pillows. mm doesn't that look comfortable. every morning escorted by the little dog they all go to the breakfast fountain with Pointed Hat and Blue Mushroom. this is an automatic fountain which serves cakes and soft drinks. Babar what's Babar trying to do here. why don't they fit him. no I think they're too small. his feet are too big for these shoes. yeah well anyway he tries. so then. oh what's happening today. what. that's right. everyone has gathered in the grandstand to watch the contestants try to unseat each_other so_that they fall out down into the big elastic net. so you mean Arthur was sitting in this egg and then this guy knocked him off. why did he knock him off. big whats. oh handles. oh hammers. you think these things are hammers. yeah they do have a little point at the end don't they. something that looks like a hammer. but they have a very long handle. Arthur bounces so high that the bumps into his flying egg. it does pop. he bumps into it and one of the big red balloons rips. oh dear. so now the punctured balloon. what's happening to it. what. oh yeah that balloon is gonna pop. it already has a big rip in it. and so all the people are rushing to get off this platform to get on a safer platform because this one's tilting downwards right. mhm. okay. oh no. that balloon collapsed. oh I think that there um that's air that comes out_of there. yeah they're making air come out. ummhm. hm. what's that. oh where's it going. it stopped. and why is it sitting right there. oh they got out. oh. oh yeah. and do you think that they're all mad at Arthur because he bumped the balloon. well wh what is he gonna do. do they all look mad. hm why do you think they're mad. oh yeah. and he bumped into the balloon. that's where he got the lump. from bumping into the balloon. the net. n but remember when he bumped into the egg. the egg is probably what gave him the lump don't you think. oh. it was from the net huh. okay. are you angry. no he says to the man are you angry. Pointed Hat hesitates before replying I'm not angry. I know perfectly well what happened to Arthur was an accident but the others are upset. this is might be dangerous for you my dear Babar. it might be better for you to return to earth. I will be sorry. I who was the one who made you come all this way because I wanted to get to know you. but I think we had better say farewell until another time. when night falls it is parting time but before leaving the soft planet Babar receives a gift an adorable little blue puppy. there they go. yeah Arthur. well Arthur's going on a flying egg so he can get up to this spaceship. see they hafta get back up to this spaceship so they can go back to their planet. so they can go back to earth. back in Celesteville they are welcomed joyfully by all their friends who thought they had perished. the little blue puppy is a great success but the Old Lady still very upset is crying. why did they kidnap you so brutally she asks. they didn't know any other way to invite us to their country. yeah there's a statue. that's Babar's grandfather though. it's his father. now that we know them said Arthur we can telephone to them and I hope that they will come to see us in Celesteville. you wanna hear go dog go. okay. what's cold. this chair is cold. your legs are cold. why are they cold. hm. yeah. well because he's saying hello to them an he's talking to them. do you have a book that has children in it. no.

he likes this thing. s I think because of maybe the feel or the sound they make. but he's really liking the keys. say. we have keys at home but these are more fun. mainly the plates and the the keys. and now the ice+cream. are they also um toy keys that you have at home. yes. okay. they're much bigger though. that's the only difference. so maybe that's why he likes them. so he's really going for those a lot. he is yes. and easy to hold. hah and now you found the blocks. so you think because they're easy to hold and maybe they make a noise. ma I he likes things that make noises. rattles and things like that. don't ya. yeah. yeah. he looks busy. um. he's usually interrupted. so this is one of the few times he hasn't been interrupted by big sister. ahhah. yeah. xxx. hah spoon. yay. um so out of these toys here what do you think is the best for his kinda personality. for his personality. um h right now he likes things that he can grab. like these things. we have a_lot_of these he xxx gone toward. he has balls that he chases at home. but he can't really go very far with them. so they sometimes frustrate him. but right now um smaller things that he can pick up with his hands. um. you said these kinds of things is xxx because of the rattle part of it or what. the sounds. the sounds they make. oh okay. so these are nice but he likes things that make sounds. so not so much these. at least for him. yeah your sister liked stuffed animals didn't she. let's see um. what do ya think interests him the least of the stuff we have here. right now um the books. just because he we have a set time during the day that we read them. I think. so he's useta reading them before nap and before bed. and so I guess his regular play toys he doesn't get them that often. but. yeah. if so let's say it is bedtime or whatever of the books that we have here what do you think would be best for him xxx. xxx. well right now with us we like the Touch_And_Feel things. and then we've also been reading the small Doctor_Seuss stuff. a lot at home. mainly because we've already had them so. um things that are short. and rhyme. he's doesn't have a preference for that but we tend to read ones that rhyme because that's what his sister liked. don't we yeah. so we've read the abcs and the foot book. and the eye book. short ones. short. ones that rhyme. yeah. or you said um. or feel just because he can we let him play with it more. right. see. the ducks. the ducks. and you want the toy. because mommy will let you put that in your mouth. I heard you doing some animal stuff. does he um do you read books about animals. or do animal type stuff. yes. um mostly books. so we do a few songs. like we do itsy_bitsy spider. things like that. mainly just your standard nursery rhyme type ones. so and he gets a lot of that influence mainly because of his sister. I bet. he's getting a lot of fun learning just by. yeah. things that I didn't think of to do for her when she was this age. xxx. do you think that there are any of these items that he would recognize the name of. any of these toys. no probably not at this point. do you have toys like. you said xxx stuffed animals. we have stuffed animals. how about the baby dolls. we have the dolls. and so far no interest. okay. how about the play food kitchen type things. um he likes to play with the stuff. I don't know if he actually recognizes it for what it is. but he likes to play with it. so hm your daughter must have xxx. oh yeah lots. he has access to that. oh yeah. okay so you you don't think he would recognize any of that these food. I_mean I realize they don't all look really that much like food but. um do you think he would recognize any of these food items here. probably not only becau. well and part of that is is because he's not taking to food right now. um he hasn't liked solid food at all except for just toast and crackers. that's it. so we can't get him to eat any food other than that. where you going. you said no interest in dolls right. not yet. he could but. they're they're available but he hasn't shown any interest. no. okay. but he doesn't have total access to it since he's not crawling yet. so once he crawls he could change. xxx. yes. that's very interesting. yeah. um alright that's all my questions. yeah. do you are there any things that I didn't ask that you feel like would be helpful in terms of what he likes and what he how he plays. anything like that. um a lot of his play is with his sister almost all of it. so a lot of is like the interaction with her things that she shows him. um mainly because she takes over for me haha. she she insists on doing it. things like that so. most of it's just all with his sister. okay. so whatever she shows him and and then he's probably xxx interested. yeah. and then he does and then otherwise he does like his play on his own. like when I'm putting her to sleep he'll be playing with his toys in his crib and. so. and then it's usually um he does have a couple of stuffed animals that he plays with. so one's a big monkey and. ah then the other ones are all ones that make noise. okay. great","Flesch_Kincaid_score":1.0137545512957828,"Flesch_Kincaid_gradelevel":1},"example_id":"c37ced96-6e7c-4d31-9ac2-77d040d1c450","annotations":[{"end":15,"tag":"Perceptual","start":11,"value":"only","tag_id":"3302eb94-c347-42d4-a94e-fa696faadced","correct":true,"reviewed":true,"example_id":"c37ced96-6e7c-4d31-9ac2-77d040d1c450","annotated_by":[{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-18T16:06:41.264+00:00","annotator_id":5},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T08:14:27.23+00:00","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","timestamp":"2023-09-17T12:11:45+00:00","annotator_id":4}],"definition_id":"93ebd1cc-f1a7-4d45-9328-03af31c46704","tagged_token_id":"0e2091b5-cc4f-460f-b94f-01467c2d2cf4"},{"end":4,"tag":"Anthropomorphized","start":0,"value":"that","tag_id":"3d4327e2-56d5-4da0-a591-1aac6ff5fa9d","correct":null,"reviewed":false,"example_id":"c37ced96-6e7c-4d31-9ac2-77d040d1c450","annotated_by":[{"annotator":null,"timestamp":null,"annotator_id":null}],"definition_id":"93ebd1cc-f1a7-4d45-9328-03af31c46704","tagged_token_id":"533d0886-b053-4e86-a369-95477c17be47"}],"classifications":[]},{"content":"that's the road over there.","seen_by":[{"annotator":"syu03@stanford.edu","annotator_id":4},{"annotator":"pmiao@stanford.edu","annotator_id":5}],"comments":[],"metadata":{"":3262,"Unnamed: 0":3262,"word_count":1864,"transcript_id":7306,"transcript_text":"what're you looking at Adam. oh really. okay. come on. put yours on. maybe we should set this. where shall we put that. do you. do they have one there. let him play it too. does that balance. you what. you love Colorform. oh channel nine. what's sposta happen to it. what is this. the big thing. channel nine is going on first. do you have one like this at school Adam. you don't have any of those. may I see it a minute please. you put yours on. okay Adam what happened. why don't you try it again. you've finished. have you finished playing with this right now. alright. put it back.

Paddington Bear at the Zoo yeah. one day Jonathan and Judy decided to take Paddington on an outing to the zoo. Paddington made a large pile of marmalade sandwiches. six in all and they set out. but when they came to the zoo gates the man wouldn't let them in. I'm sorry he said. pets aren't allowed in the zoo. pets repeated Jonathan. Paddington isn't a pet. he's one of the family. Paddington gave the man such a hard stare he let them go in without further ado. come on said Jonathan. when they were inside. let's go and see the animals and I'll take your photograph. give a great big smile. say cheese. cheese said Paddington. squawk said the parrot and it took a big bite out of Paddington's sandwich. thank you very much squawk squawk. look_it he's eating the whole sandwich. next they went to the Siberian wild dog. the Siberian wild dog went oops so Paddington threw him the rest of the sandwich to keep him quiet. see him. there goes his sandwich he's gonna eat it huh. hee haw brayed the young donkey and it wouldn't move until Paddington had given him his second marmalade sandwich. that's two gone said Judy. Paddington's smile was getting less cheesier all the time. they only. yeah that's right. the only ones who didn't say anything were the penguins. they just stood there looking rather sad as if they were all dressed up for a party with no place to go. Paddington felt so sorry for them he gave them sandwich number five. penguins eat fish said a man said sternly. he pointed to a sign. it is strictly forbidden to give them marmalade sandwiches. and while Paddington Paddington was looking at the sign the man helped himself to the last sandwich. now Paddington's sandwiches were all gone. the nerve of it said a lady. here have some of my bread. thank you very much Paddington said. and before anyone could stop him he ate it all up. I don't think that's quite what the lady meant said Judy. zoos make you hungry Paddington said Paddington firmly. especially this one. just to finish things off the mountain goat ate Paddington's sandwich bag. that does it said Jonathan. I think we'd better go home before anything else happens. a few days later Jonathan showed Paddington the photographs he had taken at the zoo. you can have one for your scrap book he said. which do you like best said Judy. the one with the parrot said Paddington promptly. at least the parrot said thank you when he ate my marmalade sandwich. that's more than any of the others did. it's all
